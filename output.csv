"Bridget Jones, modern day woman, brillant and doesn't know it, prone to accidents and mess ups but manages to come out of them.  ",positive
"I am ordering copies for all 23 middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the Milwaukee Public Schools system. We will use Wheatley's book as the primary resource  for our professional growth at our MPS Middle School Principals  Collaborative institute August 9-11, 1999. We are not just concerned with  reform; we seek renewal as well. Wheatley provides the basis. She notes  that Einstein said that  a problem cannot be solved from the same  consciousness that created it. The entire book is a marvelous exploration  of this philosophy",positive
"As a casual piano player and a Broadway fanatic, I was so jazzed to play some of the songs from Avenue Q. The book contains everything you find on the CD and includes a few production photos.",positive
"This is one of the best biographies I have ever read. You can tell the authors put a lot of time and effort into this work - it's a true labor of love. Filled with beautiful photos and extensive bibliographical notes, this one is a keeper. Who knew Miss Francis was such a ""wild child""? Whether you're a film scholar or a movie buff, Lynn Kear's book deserves a special spot in your bookcase.",positive
"I read this book many, many years ago on a very long flight.  I couldn't put it down.  The philosophy is simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too can be a millionaire.  It's great advice, especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house, expensive car, and everything else right NOW, with no regard to the future.  Although some of the info is dated (Enron being named as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes plenty of sense.",positive
"This book was someone else's bookclub selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, ""stock"" phrases, and ""hanging"" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However, I found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  I found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  I also liked Dr. Temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  Great idea! Although the book really goes all over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my ""seeking/hunting"" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold",positive
I have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  I consider this book to be the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  It also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I found that as President of my congregation I was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  It was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have been impossible anyway) I found that he described President Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam).  His discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    If you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society. ,positive
The best book on the history of World War II that I've read in a long time. ,positive
*** REFERS TO CD RECORDING ****,positive
Zadie Smith is one of the most powerful authors I have read in recent times. She is so subtle about the race factor that we don't get to find out the races of the protagonists till the first 50 pages or so. She has also captured the emotions of Kiki and Zora perfectly (why is it that women always stand out in emotional moments!) and the characters stay with you even after you put the book down.,positive
"I've been very critical of the fiction work of John Grisham in recent years and have said many times that he needed to take more time to write his novels to make the stories more interesting.  Well, he has taken time off of writing novels to write this interesting, if not spectacular non-fiction work of the trials and tribulations of Ronald Williamson, a former minor league baseball player implicated in a murder and sentenced to death row.  I won't go into the details of Williamson's ordeal, but I will say that Grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book, that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers, but is still interesting nonetheless.  He does a good job giving the details of Ron's case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and Ron suffered from growing mental issues.  Grisham didn't even think about writing Ron's story until after Ron passed away, so there are no interviews to draw upon, but he does a decent job of tying it all together.  I will also say that although he is anti-death penalty, he doesn't hammer that opinion at you.  He lets the story itself do the talking.",positive
"Zig Ziglar has done it again. As an author myself of sales books,  I realize sales is about so much more than just having the 'gift of gab,' and fast talking. It's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers. It's about not just being a consultant to others, but being a consultant to yourself. It's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is. Zig's theories exemplify this.",positive
"A quick search in Amazon books under the name ""Benjamin Franklin"" comes up with 2403 matches. Based upon that criteria, many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about Ben Franklin has been said.  Those people would be emphatically wrong, as has been proven by author and historian H.W. Brands in his work on Franklin, THE FIRST AMERICAN: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. Brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in American history, back to life, once more, in this book which was a Pulitzer finalist in 2002.",positive
"I didn't discover the delight that is the Artemis Fowl series until a week ago, when I read ARTEMIS FOWL in one day.  So, of course, I had to pick up a copy of THE ARCTIC INCIDENT right away, to see if it was as good as the first.  It definitely is, and in my own humble opinion, I think I liked it even better than the first book.  There are points throughout the book where Artemis, now thirteen, shows a softer, more vulnerable side that I truly enjoyed.  Don't get me wrong, he's still an evil genius, but he's an evil genius with heart, and you can't help but love him.",positive
"   While I am only a high school Sophmore, and I don't have a *real* job, this book has been very helpful in deciding what to shoot for doing. I've heard people call this book too vague, but they can't tell you exactly what to do; it doesn't work that way. Once you get through the personality quiz portion, the author gives a somewhat detailed description of your specific personality type (I for example am and ENFP) and throws in suggestions in the description and also give a modest list of other possibilities. I'll admit it was a bit vauger than I had hoped but it gives you plenty of room to move around and a great place to start. ",positive
"Beautiful, stunning absolutely gorgeous.",positive
I loved this book. The food was really good and fast (which is good because I have a very packed schedule). Also great if you're on a budget. The recipes have variations so I could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants.,positive
"The NY Times Book Review linked this novel to the aftermath of 9-11, but that may have more to do with the preoccupation of New Yorkers than with the story Powers wrote. While he does refer to 9-11 early on, this book concerns environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong-headed economic development in the Great Plains at the western edge of the midwestern farming belt. It is about the struggle not to loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of America in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to the changing scale of agricultural operations. But since it is a Richard Powers novel, it is also about much more: neuro-physiology, brain function as reflected in behavior and personality, the devotion of a 30ish sister to her less-able younger brother, her sexual relations with two very different men, and a nationally-known writer (clearly modeled on Oliver Sachs) who has a late mid-life crisis. It is about love, devotion, and doing as much of the right thing as one can do. It involves escape and return. ",positive
I must say my first reaction was to be surprised at how much better Hawking is at explaining modern physics than my college instructors were.  Heisenberg's uncertainty principle was just an equation I learned.  Hawking made it seem like common sense.,positive
The journal format is a unique take on the genre and I especially like the detailed attention given to gear and survival.  The author obviously knows his stuff.  What's also impressive is that this novel is self published.  I'm surprised someone hasn't taken notice and offered J.L. Bourne a deal.  He's good,positive
"College stoner cult following aside, Hunter S. Thompson's journalistic prowess was a vital national resource up until he left us last February.  Thompson was one of those brave few who dared to cut through popular media perceptions and glittery rhetoric and travel right to the ugly center of his subject material, counjouring hilarious allegories where the average journalist would already have soiled himself in disillusionment.  ",positive
"Bob Quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era. But his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we'd least like to go -- inside ourselves. I found this an incredibly powerful book. I've used sections of it with my ""change management"" classes for several years and I know it has a tremendous impact on students, who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy. If you want a simple formula for change, don't buy this book. Although it is full of practical, actionable ideas, ""Change the World"" addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for. It's a very difficult but rewarding assignment",positive
This is the BEST book written by Stephen King!  I've read it twice and will probably read it about ten more times before I die,positive
"I in 1996 I bought and read All the Pretty Horses first. Laughed myself off the train seat in to town.  Bought the whole lot and read them in chronological order - re-reading Pretty Horses on the way.  Along with scenes from the Orchard Keeper, Sutree sticks in my mind - images ideas, flavours, jokes, and a personality that I'd rather see more of.  Sutree made me feel that I know this man, and could even like him.  Great fun, and deserves selfish time to read and unwind after reading.",positive
"I'm way over the age of 13, but I just loved this book.  Interesting story and characters that I enjoyed spending time with",positive
Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor:,positive
This book is NOT about ALL people. It is about gifted (in this case that means sensitive) children that are misused to feed their parents narcissism. Most children are not that sensitive and hence not suseptible to that specific abuse.,positive
"This is an extraordinary biography for, while Blumenson's admiration for George Patton is evident, it brilliantly illustrates all the sides of Patton's personality - both positive and negative. The book truly goes  beyond the popular perception of the General -and far beyond the movie- in  exploring his character and motivations. Not an overly long book, but  thorough, detailed, and very enjoyable to read",positive
"Gibbon's ""Decline and Fall"" is without a doubt one of the most well-written and truly comprehensive historical works concerning the Roman Empire.  From the military maneuvers of the northern legions to the intrigues of the Imperial Court, Gibbon showcases the history of Rome as it unfolded--often relying on the eyewitness testimony of contemporary writers to give readers a sense of the passions and policies of the time.  There are a few minute problems--or rather gaps--in Gibbon's work, but given that he originally published in the late 1700's we can excuse his lack of complete information.  Overall, an excellent read and a great history of such an important subject",positive
"I have probably close to a dozen or more people I know, including myself, that have read this and had great results removing all sorts of chronic symptoms.",positive
"Because the ideas and strategies really work! Robert Allen gives more concrete information, real meat if you will in one chapter than these other so called financial authors do in an entire book.",positive
This book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in New York City. Necessary reading for those who still do not  realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which  marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further  fragment and disenfranchise them,positive
"Patriotic terrorist fighting storyline.  Exposes the political games played in Washington, that many times put our military in dangerous situations.  This book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the Special Forces men who are so brave.  I know the book is fiction, but I can't help but feel that it is more truth than fiction.  Mitch Rapp's wife Anna is getting a little hard to stomach.  She is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man. Again, hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations.  I hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it, although 95% is absolutely wonderful and inspiring, portraying men as REAL MEN. ",positive
"Since 1965 I've taught this ""truth"" based upon metaphysical studies.  Now, at last, there is scientific evidence supporting the fact that EMOTIONS CREATE FACTS",positive
"Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his ""best"" for last.  While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.",positive
"Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on",positive
"I bought this book just recently and was really touched (and cried) by the whole experience that Gus had went through. He has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance (Stephanie) and without her, he could've been out there on the street again. Overall, it's a good book to read and I always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another, this book is a genuine prove.",positive
I read these books just for fun thinking I would finish in a few days and not think about it past that. Well I had another thing coming. I couldn't put the book down once I had started. I missed hours of sleep because of these books. If you want a book that can keep you enraptured for hours read the Artemis Fowl books you won't regret i,positive
"Great heartwarming stories about a boy, 2 owls and a dog.  I recommend this for all ages.  The cover markets this as a childrens's book, but adults who like animals will love this story too.  A bird lovers' delight",positive
This cookbook is the best in my collection - and I have a lot!! The instructions are clear and the pictures are great,positive
Arrived on time and in terrific shape! Thanks,positive
"Ever since starting on the SIMPLE ABUNDANCE journey with Sarah Ban Breathnach's first book, I have longed for an opportunity to learn one-on-one from the Queen of simplicity and authenticity. We may not be able to meet Sarah face-to-face, but now anyone can enjoy a workshop  atmosphere in the comfort of her own home. Women caught up in the  day-to-day deluge of deadlines, appointments, and commitments can now curl  up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self. I highly recommend this  book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur",positive
"Tina Dirmann did a fantastic job writing about this difficult case, which encompasses motherhood, mental illness, child abuse, and matricide. Dirmann does not interject her own biases or agenda into her writing, rather she presents the many different angles of this story in a compassionate fashion. That, in and of itself is impressive, because many writers of true crime tend to lean one side or the other,get caught up in emotion, and appear unable to really present all sides of the story. Lessons can be learned from this book regarding mental illness and society's responsibility to help families who are in need of intervention. It is so sad that the extended families of these boys failed not only them, but also tragically failed their mother.",positive
Very topical. Easy read. Hope people in the know read this and give serious thought to the potential for something like this happening.  Gives good reason why border control should be taken more serious by everybody. Looking forward to reading other books by Mr. Bell,positive
"With every Grisham book I read, I get more and more impressed with his ability to not only use the law to create suspense, but to insert other elements to make this human as well.",positive
"This book, Styron's finest, is about redemption.  Heralded by the epigraph from John Donne, the intricately structured tale with its Marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that  it's impossible to put down.  But it's also to Styron's great credit that  the novel's theme, redemption through confrontation with death and  violence, is reflected through its feverish style.  There are not many  books in the postwar era, and none in the United States, that have such a  non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact.  Echoes of the  Greek tragedians (several times evoked in the text) and of Dostoyevski  abound.  Finally, the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate  character, a philosophical Italian small-town cop named Luigi, elevates the  moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers  don't even seem to understand, let alone approach.  It's a shame that  Styron has not received the Nobel Prize yet",positive
I read the good Doctor's book Eat to Live and then bought China Study which he talks a lot about in this book.  Then I bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though I do feel he's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a Doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own.  ,positive
"From the beginning of Ruby's story, through all the footnotes of life, to the burying of Bunty...we live four generations of the Lennox family.  This is not your average family, people disappear, mothers leave families, children die in mysterious ways.  ",positive
"Very detailed information about Hypothyroidism, Can help anyone with a low basal temperature. If you think you are hypo and your doctors won't help you read this book and you will find a doctor who will help you. Lots of knowledge about this condition. Must read",positive
"This book gives the reader a fascinating and personal look inside not just the foster care system, but why they are very much so needed.  Young Dave's life was very likely saved by being taken from his mother's home and placed into foster care.  But this book makes it clear, that despite this positive change in is life, it certainly didn't mean everything was ""happily ever after"".  Dave then struggled with issues ranging from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years olds know by that age, ranging from as simple as how to take a proper bath to how to behave with proper manners.  It also gives you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes and parents go through.  They deal day in and day out with children coming from troubled homes, and these foster homes are in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim.  I think many of us, myself included, are unaware of just what a struggle it is for both the foster children and the foster parents, as well as how much we need to support these people.  They are dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause.",positive
Neverwhere is one of Gaiman's best yet!  I highly recommend this novel,positive
"I expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised me because it wasn't ""mathy"" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula.",positive
"I really enjoyed this coloring book--as in my very early yrs., I had kaleidoscopes to play with.  I was always intriqued with the color spectrum in them.I was hoping to find more on line with the illustrator of this book.  Sadly disappointed.  Will keep looking at other book sites. By the way, I am 56 yrs. old--and I love to color.  It's wonderful therapy for relaxing and bringing back some childhood fun",positive
"This was the first sales book I ever read. And today, 10 years later, I have it proudly displayed in my library. When I speak with clients who I now teach sales skills to, I still reference it from back in my days selling copiers in 1994. Way to go Stephan!",positive
"If you like math, I guarantee you'll like this book! The author starts out with some very nice infinite sums from 17th and 18th century mathematics (Newton, Leibniz, the Bernoullis, and Euler's Gamma function). He continues into the 19th century with Riemann and Lebesque integrals, Weierstrass' pathological functions, Cantor's set theory, and winds up with Baire's category theorem.",positive
"Painstakingly compiled by Judy Brown (contributing writer and comedy critic for LA Weekley), The Funny Pages is an impressive and hilarious collection of 1,473 jokes gathered from the funniest modern-day comedians around, ranging from Robin Williams to Bill Cosby, George Burns, Conan O'Brien, and many, many more. The individual jokes are arranged by topic underneath dictionary-style headings. From Alcohol to Yoga and Zoos; each gag is short but sweet, and packs a punch in this chuckle-inducing, highly recommended anthology of wit, gags, and humor both classic and cutting edge",positive
"Brilliant. Sam Harris portends the calamitous pathway that irrational, divisive thinking (religious & secular) will cause. He also spells out the necessary suggestions and goals for humans to evolve to the point where we're globally not at risk of suffering due to anachronistic prejudices",positive
This book turns the entire concept of intelligence inside out. Seriously mind-blowing. Excellent exercise in extended mental gymnastics. You won't be disappointed,positive
"This book clearly, easily teaches the 5 different ways we each relate to one another.    It is applies very well to couples; however, the principles also provide essential insight into relating with children, colleagues... anyone!  It makes an excellent group book study or a read-on-one's own",positive
"So many disbelievers out there! I feel so sorry for you: no magic left in your dull and predictable worlds? Of course this book is on the level. While my dog Ernestine does not build art pieces as such, she's a pretty good cook and a crack shot. So why not dog artists? The review of dog art is a little species-centric, however. Most of the dog artists I know use faecies or urine to construct art, or engage in performance pieces: ""Rooting The Leg""; and ""Licking The Balls"" spring to mind. Dog culture can be appreciated by humans but is not the SAME as human cuture. So a little less chauvanism please Ms Mathison",positive
"This was my very first book for Nora Roberts, and so far it's the best book EVER.  It is THE PERFECT book.  Brianna is a wonderful, smart inn keeper with many talents and a rare kind of maturity.  I would love to be like her!  And Gray is a successful, sweet, caring, witty author that comes to her inn in Ireland to relax and start a new book.  This is no ordinary romance.  I love that it goes deep, not only into the main characters' personalities, but there is also Brianna's sister and brother-in-law, her mother, her friend, and Gray's agent.  Not to mention the wonderful scenary of Ireland described throughout the book.  The conlcusion of the book is wonderful and utterly satisfying, leaving you with a happy glow that lasts a long time!  Other books by Nora Roberts are good, but this one takes the prize.  Of the Born trilogy this one is the best and it should NOT be missed",positive
I really had no faith before this book.  Not really sure what I should of beleived.  But this book def changed my point of view and it is shocking! Eveything just seemed ot come together and to me it just makes complete sense and I feel that this book is entirely true.   It would be great to see the world come together in world peace if they only knew the truth.  I knew the government covered stuff up but I had no idea to the extent they would goto to keep their undreground society such a secret and ruthless and would stop at nothing.  He doesn't say it straight out but the way it is described protrays this secret rogue group to be the illumnati with unlimited funding to carry out their evil intentions.  Greatest book I ever rea,positive
"I have never been a big fan of motivational books, because they seem so ""pie in the sky"" if you know what I mean. But a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different. He was right. It was easy to read and in fact I didn't want to put it down. But what I really liked was the ""how to"" part of the book. After all, it's no good reading about other people's success stories if you don't know how to make your own. Also, something I thought was interesting is that the author has a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder several times a day. I guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and this website doesn't let you forget. Hmmmmm . . . electronic nagging as the key to success! ;-) Hey, whatever works",positive
"Theodore B. Taylor, the physicist who was the subject of this book died in 2004, but not before he had completed his spiritual journey from nuclear bomb maker to nuclear protester.  Even though the text of this book originally appeared in ""The New Yorker"" in 1973, Taylor was still driven to publish his own works on the dangers of nuclear proliferation.  McPhee has a very understated style (""just the facts, ma'am""), but this book is still the most frightening I've ever read.  I can't decide whether I would want him to write a sequel, because the threat of a nuclear bomb explosion is even greater today than it was in 1973.  Just ask yourself the following questions:",positive
I bought this book after a recent trip with my family to Italy.  The food was so wonderful that I wanted to learn more about it.  Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.  It explains the basics as well as the regional specialties.  I learned so much!  I highly recommend it,positive
"These are all short stories, some very short; that's what he wrote. I remember reading a number of these (the science fiction ones mostly) in translation years ago. Rereading them now in the context of all his other work was really very interesting. As a collection of all his fictions, some of the items are a bit repetitive; the variations on the ""knife fight"" theme for instance. But the range of his imagination is fascinating, particularly in his thoughts about reality vs imagination and layers of reality and identity: a lot of it presages the information-based world of today, which sometimes seems to have left hard reality behind.",positive
"Once again Mr. Updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women  - love, lust, betrayal, self doubt.  Villages relates Owen's life as only John Updike can.  The last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book, but I will certainly recommend it to all my friends",positive
"I really like this series of books that range from this ""Storage"" one to ""Bathrooms,"" ""Family Houses,"" etc...  but I am giving this book a 4 because it shows alot of houses that seem to be beyond the means of most people that I know around my area.  This book also likes to tell you to build storage in every little crack/space that does not currently have something useful going for it.  I am giving it 4 stars, because it does inform you of all of the different types of devices that are currently (as of the book being published) available to help you make storage possible in nooks and crannies.  It also gives you ideas and suggestions about how you can make more use out of the storage that you already have, by redesigning the shelving to make it more attractive also.  Try not to read it all at once though, because I started to gloss over stuff just to get to the end of the book.  Take it a step at a time and it will be a great start for you",positive
"I read an interview with Mr. Vollman, I think a couple years ago, I can't quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people.  They save marriages, they provide comfort to the loneliest, most desperate among us.  In practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns.",positive
"This is the text I love the best and it is easy to read and with the words of Jesus in red.  My only criticism in that the corners of the cover tend to bend - they are made of cardboard which is not as durable as leather, for which I would have paid more.  However, it is very good value, and the delivery was as swift as ever",positive
"This is a wonderful book, aimed at helping the struggling new mom with the all-too-often misunderstood Post-Partum Depression symptoms.  While I am thrilled that such a renowned star is willing to share her story for the benefit of others, I urge Brooke Shields to re-consider a comment she made recently. She indicated that while she KNOWS now that Post-Partum Depression is real and requires treatment of both medicinal and therapy support,...she does NOT believe that ADHD exists nor that it requires the same level of support.  It is essential that such public figures realize that what they HAVE experienced is not the ONLY form of reality.  Thousands suffer with ADHD in ways that interfere with their livlihood, schooling, relationships and self-esteem issues.  Studies have shown this challenge to be as REAL and as DEBILITATING as Post Partum Depression.  So please,Brooke...don't deny the realities of OTHER maladies, simply because you haven't experienced them. You of all people should realize how frustrating it is to have your challenges blown off by others. Your ""voice"" is heard loudly.  Your message must be correct.  Thank you",positive
"Beginning with the introduction, I was taken on a fabulous journey. These gifted authors write a wonderful narrative.  Lande's Snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion. They are as engaging as any short story in the New Yorker!",positive
"This author has written ""Kitchen Table Wisdom"" which was recommended to me a year ago by my doctor..Ms Remen remembers her Zayde who died whe she was 7 and tells us all the wonderful things he taught her...She is a physician and therapist and combines the lessons she learned at age 7 with her professional knowledge..I love this book and find myself returning to it time and time again to re-read the stories of strength, refuge and belonging..this book is much more than ""chicken soup""...it is ""chicken soup with matzo balls",positive
This is such a Great book I have boughten copeys for all my childern,positive
"This book was a life saver for me as I opened my solo practice this summer. Without it, I would have spent countless hours developing these forms myself. The feature that allows you to customize the forms is especially nice. I recommend this for new or veteran mental health workers",positive
"There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal.",positive
"This book is a very good study into what happen to the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Mr. Capt did a Great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in Assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the Assyrians which is called the House of Omri. This book is very in depth and very informative. I also noticed a person left one star because Mr. Capt did say anything about the Jews. Of course the Jew's wouldn't be metioned they weren't taken into exile until 586 bce, and that was by Babylonia and not Assyria. When reading about the Ten Tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not Jews. Over all I give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid Bible reader intrested in research",positive

"This book is a rare but insightful look into the practice of one of the New Urbanist legends. UDA began the pattern book revival a decade ago (and also has a book out describing the process of writing one.) They also are one of the pioneers of the New Urbanist revolution, which, by discarding the fictions of Modernist planning, have rediscovered existing methods and have discovered new methods of creating compact, mixed-use and walkable neighborhoods that were always the basic cellular structure of cities from the dawn of time until just before World War II. We have understood the basic principles again for some time. What this book shows are some of the mechanics of how to do it again",positive
"Rarely is there a book that I can not put down, this was an exception. Quite a suspensfull page turner. Any book that can draw you in and you can visualize the characters and the scenery is excellent and this book did that.

"What an absolute lifesaver! As parents of two kids- (one dreamer and one dynamo) we had run through the endless &quot;experts&quot; in our town for answers. This is a priceless resource for anyone who wants to stand up with facts to experts in both the medical and the school-related fields. It gives reasons for behavior and what works ,and more importantly, why what a lot of people want you to do won't work! I have given it to each teacher/specialist who works with my children. Her advice does work and your special bright child will blossom with it. It is written in an engaging and segmented format. Be sure to read the part addressing whether or not to medicate.

"Left for dead by her kidnappers, Lore is found by the mysterious woman Spanner, who teaches her to survive by her wits and to live in the dark world of crime. The two become lovers, but Lore wants legitimacy and to heal from her various wounds (her past with her family, her weeks with the kidnappers), so she leaves, taking a new identity, and tries to fit in. Ultimately, Lore cannot run from her demons forever, and she must either choose to stay in the shadows or to face the truths of her past. Set in the not-so-distant future, &quot;Slow River&quot; weaves Lore's pasts and present together into an astonishingly compelling tale. At the heart of the book is the story of a young woman healing from abuse, and the science fiction aspects are simply the setting and enhancing details. &quot;Slow River&quot; is the type of book that transcends whatever genre in which it's placed: it's more than a science fiction story, more than a coming-of-age story, more than a lesbian love story, more than a story of healing from abuse. This is a book that makes one believe in the power of fiction",positive

"A refreshing look on software development and the many pitfalls you need to avoid.  This book should be read by everybody involved in any software project but the simplest. In my opinion, a standard work.  Nevertheless, it needs to be handled with care.  During ages, SW development managers have tried convincing their people to break out of the chaos, and plan their work.  This book correctly warns for the opposite effects of believing that planning solves everything. Some people might however read between the lines that no planning at all is the best practice. The book confirms what I and my successful colleagues found through experience and intuition: there is an optimal point of planning upfront.  Less harms because you don't know where you are going, more (too detailed) harms because it takes away flexibility and it slows you down significantly. ",positive

"These are true tales from a clinical neurologist's notebook, but this isn't just any neurologist.  Oliver Sacks, author of the justly celebrated, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986) and Awakenings (1973), which was later made into a movie starring Robert DeNiro and Robin Williams, and other works, is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity.  He has a style that is both affecting and fascinating, yet studiously objective, a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations, historical comparisons and wisdom.  Part of the power of these tales, and of all of Sacks's work, is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality.  This makes for a compelling read.  If you've never read Sacks before, you are in for a very special treat.",positive

"This book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader. Chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist, and his experiences in Kenya. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology. A forensic anthropologist has a Ph.D. and studied anthropology, specializing in the human skeletal system. Chapter 3 tells about his laboratory, and the tools used for his work. Chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. Chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs. The Interstate Highway System provides arteries for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). Chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide. Many people kill themselves without intending to. It is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86). Page 87 tells why Florida has an inordinate number of suicides. Chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders.

"I expected a fabbo edge-of-the-seat read.  What I DIDN'T expect was that this pomo thriller would provide a passel of top-flight management secrets to its unsuspecting readers.  From the opening pages of the book, as Wylie Jones prepares to depart on a &quot;business trip&quot; of unspecified duration, to the penultimate chapter, when a revitalized Wylie and his attentive amanuensis wrap up a deal on the Left Coast, this beach-bag zinger is chock full with the sorts of advice, hints, tips, and warnings that help to build healthy management brains in twelve ways!  Think of it as a kind of business allegory.  Wylie's cross-country odyssey is what might happen if Robert Fulghum were to meet John Gardner trundling down the road on his reality bike, set fire to Robertson Davies' beard, and then move on over to the Highway Hacienda for corn dogs and a brew with none other than Warren Buffet, Everyone's Favorite Grassroots Investor.

"Nine months ago I was hired to help turnaround a once successful business.  From day one I realized that this was a company without focus.  It's one thing to define a problem, another to find a solution.  Haneberg's book was a shot in the arm.  Just one concept -- ""Stop Multitasking"" -- would have been a major breakthrough for my team.  And, personally, the idea of doing ""One Great Thing"" has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job.  This book immediately rose to the rank of three or four ""must read"" titles in my business library.  In the couple of months since I first read it (and I've re-read it a couple of times) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions -- we're nailing deadlines, we're closing more sales, we're thinking more strategically across the board.  In a business and social environment that throws more at us day-by-day, hour-by-hour, this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago.  We're all doing more with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities.  If it's true, as Woody Allen says, that 98% of success is showing up, then the other 2% is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there.  This is the manual for getting your business -- and your life -- where you want it to be",positive
"To learn some Italian before visiting Italy, I tried multiple language-learning programs borrowed from my local library. Some were ridiculous, many required using a workbook.  Then I stumbled on the Pimsleur program, which is totally audio, allowing me to learn Italian while I drove to and from work. Due to the pedagogically- sound method Pimsleur developed for language learning, I actually did learn some basic Italian.  As a result I bought ""Conversational Italian."" Though I've never considered myself adept at language-learning, I actually felt confident in my ablility to learn Italian as a result of these CDs. I've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language",positive
"My boyfriend bought From the Earth to the Moon, and since he is an Astrophysics student I expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people's conceptions about going to the moon at that early time.  He however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn't make much sense. Well, from a layman's perspective I found from the Earth to the Moon engaging.  It goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic, Physics and Astronomy.  Even from my scientifically deprived perspective, a lot of things in the book didn't make much sense, such as the actual method of getting to the moon, but this doesn't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal.  The book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous. I was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work, and what these poor souls were going to come up with next.  Compared to Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and even Journey to the Centre of the Earth however, From the Earth to the Moon is noticeably less imaginative. Verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality, and much unlike his other works, doesn't stray far from the earthly. Some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion, but all in all From the Earth to the Moon is a good read.  If you drop at the sight of f(x) = y, then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking, Centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate.  If you really know your Physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today. If you, like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then From the Earth to the Moon is definitely worth your time. ",positive

"This is an excellent, fascinating and insightful read.  Dr Guarneri knows her stuff and has writen this book well.  She wrote it because obviously we need to think about nutrition, cholesterol and excercise, but there are deeper issues too like peoples emotions.  She believes that heart problems can be caused by the stress's in our lives and our emotions - we could litterally die of a broken heart.  Emotional events can weaken heart muscles.  You produce stress hormones when you are upset which raise blood sugars and blood pressure etc which ultimately weaken or can destroy the heart.  She talks about this in the book and on the flip side, talks about happy people too and how positive emotions and feelings do good for our hearts.  When we are happy, our hearts beat in a coherent rythym.  She says we have to look at our hearts in various ways.  We need to look at it as a pump to keep us alive but to also look at the emotional heart, the mental heart and the spiritual heart in order to keep us healthy.  ",positive

"The Great Locomotive Chase is the stuff of legend.  This somewhat obscure event, which commemorated the first anniversary of the first shots on Fort Sumter, could too easily be written off among Civil War devotees as a lark, a foolhardy distraction from the inexorable march from Shiloh to the Seven Days, to Second Manassas, to the three more years of bloodletting that were required in order to form a more perfect union.  But first-time author Russell Bonds does a masterful job of taking this adventure story on its own terms, telling it well, and placing it in its proper context.  The raid itself is a gripping story of intrigue, espionage, and derring-do.  And if Mr. Bonds had only told the tale itself, this book would be well worth the read.  But what sets this distinguished this book apart from so much Civil War writing is Mr. Bonds's ability to tell this gripping tale objectively, while putting it in its proper context.  The author sets the table with a relatively brief yet thorough overview of the strategic arrangement of the war nine months after First Manassas.  And by doing so, and by explaining why the Raid, coupled with the deep penetration of General Ormsby Mitchell into Tennessee and North Alabama, offered the fleeting chance to cut the Confederacy in two and thereby hasten the end of the war, Mr. Bonds gives the otherwise reckless ï¿½lan of the raiders its proper place.  Andrews and his raiders were not off on a lark, even though students of the era will have the natural reaction, ""what were they thinking?""  Mr. Bonds answers that question, and the answer, as incongruous as it may seem, reminds the reader that there was so much more to the Great War than the epic battles of the Armies of the Potomac and Northern Virginia.

"'The Interface Between the Written and the Oral' is a comprehensive look at the development of writing in general and alphabets in particular, oral poetry in ancient Greece and Modern Africa, oral transmission of (written) Vedas, the impact of writing on recently oral cultures in West Africa, and the impact of writing on our own abilities of thought and organization. Perhaps the most disheartening, but nonetheless informative section, deals with the counterintuitive measures that social scientists have come up with to measure the impact of literacy. They seem to be lacking in common sense. Goody, however, is full of common sense, and this book is excellent reading",positive
"Steven Pinker has written a fascinating account of how language works; how we, as listeners, process the sounds that make up words and sentences in a way that allows us to extract meaning. The book is clear, entertaining and very accessible; Pinker's writing style is witty and engaging.",positive
"`The Savory Way' is an early (1990) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author, Deborah Madison so, as Ms. Madison has a new book on the way, I thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so I can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books.",positive
"I truly enjoyed Northern Lights.  Ms. Roberts ways with words are so descriptive and it kept me going with the mystery and growing love between the two characters in this book.  I truly enjoy Nora Roberts, she is an excellent writer.  I cannot wait to read more of her newer writings as well as her older writings. ",positive

"The Sunday Philosophy Club, and the other 2 titles in this series by John McCall Smith, are everything the fans of Mme Ramotswe would hope they would be. Leaving Botswana was hard, but now we are in Edinborough Scotland, and Isabelle Dalhousie is as wise and vulnerable and real and wonderful as her African predecessor.  It is a miracle that a man can write his women characters so believably and so lovably. It is another miracle that anyone can write such absorbing, cozy, engrossing books. This is good literature and good fun. The Sunday Philosophy Club along with Friends, Lovers,Chocolate, and the more recent The Right Attitude Toward Rain, are too wonderful to miss. Welcome to Scotland",positive

"Hacker's Challenge 2 is a sort of practical exam for the Hacking Exposed series. Hacker's Challenge was a terrific book for putting some incident response and forensic skills to use and practicing for the real thing. Hacker's Challenge 2 continues the tradition and should be a must read for anyone who works with network security and incident response. The style of the challenges is fairly entertaining and the plots are so engaging you may not want to put the book down. Its like a best-selling mystery novel for network security techies. It may not affect the quality of the book overall, but I preferred having the authors of the individual challenges identified as they were in Hacker's Challenge. However, you should definitely buy this book! ",positive
"This was one of the first books that I picked up after my divorce 17 plus years ago. I knew that I was giving these men all my love, but even with all the love I was giving them they were treating me like I did not matter. Knowing there is a problem is the first step and what a huge step that is. After reading this book the light bulb went on with a bang and it has never gone off. I have struggled with relationhsip issues, but at least I know what is going on and with each relationship I got better and better until I got it right. I learned I had to read the signs that I chose to ignore for some many years. I have been in a healthy relationship now for 8 years with a man that shows me his love(along with telling me)and treats me the way I deserve.",positive

April of 1865 has been referred to as the month that saved America but April of 1861 may have been just as vital if not more so. It was during this time that Washington DC sat completely surrounded by two states that were teetering on the verge of secession. Once Virginia did leave the Union only Maryland provided the federal government with a connection to the rest of the nation and it was a tenuous connection at best. ,positive
"I was referred to this book by my midwife (Debra O'Conner) as a book that I had to read as it's content was so &quot;right on&quot; and was she ever right.  I know alot about my body.  I am a licensed massage therapist and a mother of a 3 year old that I had at home.  I spent hours and hours learning about my body during the childbirth process.  That was great knowledge to add to the physiology I learned during my massage training.  This book though, is something that every woman in our culture today should read. I now understand so much about my life and the directions it has taken!  I hope to give this to everyone I know who has a daughter.  I hope they will read it for themselves and then pass in on to their daughters when they feel the time is right.  Our culture today is so lacking in this kind of positive message.  It is women's reality and needs to be shared.  Of course it is written by a Midwife!  Thank you Elizabeth",positive
"This book is so great and touching. As a mixed race teen this book gave me hope and confidence. It taught me to honest and open. It made me proud to be me. Never has a book made me so convinced that I am great and wonderful  to be multiracial. I thank the author for this awesome book. Anyone who is  biracial should read this book. Not just once, but over and over, marking  the poems and stories that you can most relate to and read them when you  are feeling down on yourself. This is one &quot;must have&quot; book",positive
"This book is hot!!. I anxiously awaited the next ""Grayson"" novel, after reading of course, all, the ""Falcon"" and ""Grayson"" families' stories. I honestly thought nothing could top Luke Grayson's romance with Catherine. However, Ms. Ray's story about Brandon and Faith was just that!!  I hope the next book in the Grayson saga is out very soon, because again, I can hardly wait!!  And if you have not read ALL of Francis Ray's novels(not just her stories about the Graysons and Falcons), get to reading... you will not be disappointed. ",positive

"This is one of Nora Roberts' best books ever! I have read everything she's written and this is now my all time favorite. I ADORE this book.  The characters are interesting and very human, the plot is gripping and the background fascinating.  Callie, an archeologist, comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex-husband. What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment, like most romances (including Roberts).  Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot.  It will keep you glued to the pages until you figure out who the bad guys are",positive
"I actually discovered this book accidentally. It was in the ""return to stock"" section of my Borders Book store and I was perusing the many books people had been interested in. The summary caught my attention, but it was the first page that drew me in. Even from the beginning this book is captivating. It's thrilling, tragic, heart-breaking, and even at times so amusing. Greer has a talent for making Max seem so real. I couldn't stop reading it. It's so hard to put down! Definitely one the best books I've ever read.",positive
"So many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read this book, I was like ""what the heck is wrong with my wife?""  After reading this book, I was more like ""Ohhh, I know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!""  Great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.",positive

"I have read every Hiaasen novel, except ""Flush"" and ""Naked Came the Manatee."" I have enjoyed reading almost every one of them [There are exceptions -- ""Basket Case"" definitely was not up to the mark, IMHO]. The best among them, in my opinion, are  ""Strip Tease"", and ""Double Whammy."" ""Double Whammy"" is funnier among the two. ""Strip Tease"" is a little more serious.",positive
"This book describes the eleven-year psychotherapy process for a woman with sixteen different personalities.  The analysis process took place from 1954 through 1965.  Sybil, the subject of the book, was a child of the 1920's and 30's, and her multiple-personality disease was a result of her family's genetic history and her fundamentalist, repressed, and abusive upbringing.  Much of Sybil's struggles were due to the time period in which she lived--her family had mental illness but felt that ignoring it and focusing on other pursuits was the best course of action.  She was so denied the exploration of her feelings that she choked back all symptoms of mental illness and tried to act normal, hindering her recovery for years.",positive
"I am married to a native New Yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions, many of which we still visit today. As an extra bonus for avid cooks, there are recipes. For anyone who remembers Luchows or any of the other venerable, now closed restaurants the book mentions, it will take you back to happy times and good memories. It's an excellent book and clearly Schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love.",positive
"Jmaes Joyce takes us on Stephen Daedalus' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of Dublin, struggling with sin, salvation, intellect, ambivalence about his homeland, and his father's decline.  It is not a linear path, but then whose is?  The story is not so much about the artist as a young man, but about a young man's journey to artistic sensibility, its pretensions and exhilirations.

"This book captures the human spirit, at both its best and its worst.  Schwarz-Bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of Ernie Levy, from birth and on.  He also, shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the Nazi movement.  It is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the Jewish people.  It is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a Just Man, although without them humanity would crumble, as future readers will find out their importance.  And if there really are Just Men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders",positive
"I really enjoyed this book. I found it in a bookstore one day and read it for pleasure slowly. I am a theory student (now) so I wanted to see a lot more math, but aside from that shortcoming (which some might welcome) it was just a fantastic description of fluid motion and derivations of the governing equations on a simple level.",positive
"Those who condemn this book for not being a long, boring list of name origins and meanings, or for stating that their name has gone out of style for today's children, are missing the point. ""Baby Names Now"" is a fun, readable guide to what people are naming their children in the early 2000s, including famous namesakes (saints, popes, presidents, royalty, music and movie stars) and what some celebrities have named their children. It's also fascinating to read how certain names have gone out of style: for example ""Lisa,"" ""Amy,"" ""Susan"" and ""Dawn"" were very popular for babies born in the 60s (and thus, my classmates), but are rarely used today.

In some instances I could call out the names of those I'd either worked with or had family relationships or friendships with - based on the Alpha types, strengths and risk behaviors so well defined in this book.   I found the practical tips - encouraging specific change, in those who don't seem open to changing - to be useful, hopeful, encouraging and sometimes even funny.  I may go broke sending Alpha Male Syndrome to my too-many Alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or live with them!",positive
"Carlton Mellick the 3rd's ""Punk Land"" (a pseudo-sequel to his 2001 novel ""Satan Burger"") wastes no time in getting straight to the story.  It is set in an alternate heaven for punks, where Sid Vicious is God and you are judged for entry not by St. Peter but rather a number of gate attendants who decide whether or not you are punk enough.  Mellick's trademark off-beat humor and sideways take on religion is ever-present, along with a slew of philosophical ideas mixed with a juvenile sense of mischief.  Although it is a sequel, it stands completely on it's own.  Fans of Satan Burger will appreciate the references and the continued story of Nan and Mortician, but new readers aren't left wondering about a back story.  And anyone with even a slight interest in punk rock or punk culture will be in well, punk heaven, with all the references to punk history and culture and appearances by icons including G.G. Allin, Henry Rollins, and Johnny Rotten.  The book is also full of illustrations, diagrams, photos and lists, which help to give it a wonderful multimedia type feel. You'll find yourself torn between finishing the paragraph you're in and jumping directly over to the flier for the ""PBR Pogo Joust"" advertised on the next page.  This is a great book, a sublimely goofy sort of work that is effortlessly good but never takes itself too seriously.  Highly recommended for anyone who likes Mellick's work, but even more so for anyone who has never read any of his books.  This is a great place to discover the works of a young, groundbreaking author who is only getting better with time",positive

"Music and culture are discussed, not with the usual artistic focus, but with a healthy blend of science and sociology added to the mix. Is music a luxury, an art, or a biological need?

"A remarkable introduction to Ezra Pound.  Makin explains some of the underlying structures that order the Cantos--periplous, ideogram, fugue, the 'repeat in history'--and gives concise readings of individual sections  that helped my understanding enormously.  He does an especially good job of  connecting Pound's theory of money to his views on sex and creativity.   Makin manages to be critical of Pound while treating his ideas with verve  and sympathy;  the writing is colloquial, witty and jargon-free.  I enjoyed  the Cantos much more after reading this short, effective study",positive

"This book has been golden for two of my undergrad communications classes and is turning out an invalvuable reference for my graduate level comm class, which the professor is teaching from a variety of books.

Still it is such a broad and complete coverage of all important topics it will serve as your comm encyclopedia.",positive
"Reinventing the Bazaar used real-life examples to make markets understandable to any reader.  From pharmaceutical companies to the Tokyo fish market, McMillan brings markets alive right in front of the readers' eyes.  He attempts to demystify the mystery behind markets, and in my opinion, he succeeds.  Each chapter presents a new market setting which McMillan uses to illustrate his various points.  While the book has an economic undertone, the level of writing is not above the understanding of even a high school student.  All terminology is explained not only with words, but with examples, as well.  The book was enjoyable, especially if you have little familiarity with various market settings.  However, I would encourage anyone to read this book because even the experts on markets will have their knowledge enriched by this book",positive
"The other reveiwers have it right. After studying more than 30 titles on the craft of writing, I can say that this is by far the most useful work on developing believable and well-rounded characters that I have seen to date.

Excellent work",positive
"This truly excellent collection of Singer's stories (all originally composed in the Yiddish language) are as colorful as the people about whom the stories were written. Here are tales of weddings, of jokesters, of happy occasions of all variety, of feuding farmwives, and of unrepentant fools. After reading through a handful of Singer's works, a person gets the feeling of how it must have been to live as a Jew in eastern Europe a hundred years ago. This was a culture rich in its traditions and lore, a people who loved life and kept their identity through good times and bad. Singer, himself born and raised in the region so many of his short stories describe, was one of very few authors I would unhesitantly dub ""a human treasure""",positive
"Perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in English (or at least it appears to have been, there is no translator listed), but this is by far the most lucid thing I've read by Latour.

"I assume the plot of this famous tale is well known, so I won't spend time on it, but in recently re-reading this book for the first time since ninth-grade English class in the '90's, I was repeatedly struck by a piercing question: how exactly over time does drama become melodrama? Will our cherished novels seem melodramatic to readers a hundred-forty years hence? How does this happen, and is there ever an end-point to it? Dickens was by any standard a literary master, and if typifying one's age is a virtue, then he does this to perfection, yet if failing to achieve a universality unhindered by time (as other writers have done) is a limitation, then in this one sense alone Charles Dickens has an Achilles heel",positive
"I purchased the book with the intention of teaching myself all the core material in it. The material offers readers a limited number of examples per chapter per section. While these examples may sometimes make you wish for added detail, ultimately there is enough explanation to pull the reader through. Be sure you understand the previous chapter before moving onto the next or you will most likely get lost. In the end I was very satisfied with my order. Listen to me...if your at least decent in math you'll do just fine following this Algebra 2 textbook",positive

"First off, I loved the book cover- spine and all-- one of my all time favorites. It's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store's front table. Then the title, I loved that just as much. Both share the characteristics of being straightforward, to the point, and revealing. Both are perfectly simple. I read most the essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi. I constantly begged for my dictionary. It's probably what gets him the press I knew before I picked this up: an intellectual snob. I guess he got that from the Oprah incident. But I also guess that there's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career. What's up with this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon? The attraction to Franzen's work is that he investigates and reveals- in a binary way: He's researching facts, he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give an opinion. The best example of this is My Father's Brain in which he relates the Alzheimer induced decomposing of his father's brain. There is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss. Reading it you sympathize, you empathize and you learn. Equally as insightful are :",positive
"this is the first piece of writing i have read from albert camus and i found it very interesting. the character meursault is a very indifferent character who seems to be very impartial when he hears of his mother's death and kind of continues to be static untill the the second half of the book. i do not want to give the book away as some of the others have, but i feel that no matter what one person does and no matter what ones perception is, it can never match the perception of others. one of my favorite lines in the story is when meursault is talking to the chaplain about seeking redemption through god because according th chaplain ""it is not the human justice that matters but divine justice"" and meursault's response was ""it was the human justice that put me here"". no matter what acts you commit, whether they be henous, incensitive or loving, one way or another you will be judged and upon that judgement will be your sentence. it was definitely an easy read that takes the readers on a ride into the thoughts of a man who accepts the one thing he can not change; his fate.

"Paul Johnson has written a 1,000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830, years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today.  Johnson's chosen foci are certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to music, science, and even opium use.  While almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function, Johnson's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning.  Also, while the book claims to be about ""world society,"" Johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about British society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the ""western"" United States (like Kentucky) to China and Singapore.  Throughout, his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read.  ",positive

"This is an essential read for anyone who wants a deeper understand of American foreign policy. A year after this book was published, there were over a hundred reviews. Regardless of whiether one disagrees or agrees with the author, finds the author right or wrong, interesting or boring, this book is one of the most influential books, if not the most influential book that affected American foreign policy. In fact, the current Bush Adminstration's policies, George Kenan's containment, Henry Kissinger's policies as well as countless adminstration's policies are shaped or affected by this book. My area of study is the foreign policy of Post World War Two American governments, and never have I understood it with greater clarity after I read this book. It is the thread which runs through the policies of all the administrations, differing on extent. (I studied the policies first and read the book the year after). It is a fascinating book and hard to put down. The author writes in a European style (beautiful long sentences,etc.), which in my opinion makes it more eloquent and in the opinion of my co-students makes it more difficut to read. He tries to give a balanced perspective from which one can think critically. Ms. Rice and Mr. Kissinger were heavily influenced by this book. To understand them, this is a must read. In and of itself, it is an excellent book, a classic, and thousands others significantly more qualified than I have reviewed it. Look even at other reviews on this website or at well known journals for a more accurate assement of the book itself by political scientists",positive
"What a wonderful book. It's too bad so many readers today know only Tom Wolfe, not Thomas Wolfe. Even though it has been at least 10 years since reading Look Homewood Angel, I knew almost immediately when I came to the new sections. They add a depth to the novel, bringing in the whole town and relatives, rather being only about Eugene Gant. My favorite Wolfe readings involve trains; the experience about time stopping for a moment when you look into the eyes of someone looking directly at you into the train, is exactly as I remember my earlier train rides.What are they doing now, that the train has passed? Other 800 page books might be dull, but not this one.

"When one begins to despair about the quality (or lack thereof) of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being. Not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over 240 pages one that I finished all too quickly. I could not get enough of it. The narrator and main character of the novel is a Mr. Stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly. His employer, a Lord Darlington, is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the Versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the Germans. And what did Mr. Stevens think of this? He didn't, he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate. There is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in Mr. Stevens. You'll have to read the book if you want to know more. I read mainly Victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not.

He speaks to those who are willing to put effort and excellence where their pen meets the page.I heartily recommend this book",positive
"A recent Dallas Morning News column profiling T.D. Jakes quoted a University of Houston sociology professor saying that Jakes is ""incredible in how he's able to diagnose people's pain.  He has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition."" Jakes' new book He-Motions illustrates the verity of the professor's statement.  In He-Motions, Jakes nails the issues and challenges Christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams.",positive
"I found this book very helpful in outlining the importance of research &amp; of tracking earnings estimates. Mitch Zacks gives a good overview of what the key factors are in determining whether a stock will perform. The Zacks Rank was also interesting as it looks like it has performed very well over the past years...It seems as if the Zacks Rank really is accurate, and more imporartantly a successful investing method...This is the first book I have read that has actually helped  me make money, rather than just provide broad based market overviews one sometimes reads. Overall good book, I would definitely recommend it",positive
"This is Hawking's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math.  While still not an easy read, it it much easier than the BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME that he wrote for laypeople before this.  A person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book, as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field.  Older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth",positive
"The ""Essential Histories"" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series.  They'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with, but no real depth.  Most volumns are under 100 pages; therefore, don't expect many ""man in the trenches"" stories.",positive
This was a very revealing look into how steroids played a role in baseball player success starting in the 1980s. This was an influential book which began a congressional search into the use of Steroids in baseball.,positive
"It helped me place myself in the right direction as far as choosing a college. It's hard to choose colleges just by what you hear by older people but this book is extremely useful in information you need to know before  visitng a college. I would reccomand this book. The software was useful to  me, however if you know how to write a formal essay it's no big deal",positive
"Rewind to 1992. It's the dawn of the so-called Information & Knowledge Age. Back then, I wrote a book on the need to liberate and effectively channel the creativity of all employees in an organization. The rationale: To create higher performing organizations in a time of intense global competition. With pressing needs for superior innovation. And improved productivity. Amid ever-leaner budgets. (Sound familiar?)",positive
This book is as close to perfect as you can get. I personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of India.,positive
"This book is the equivalent of the Proustian madeleine...to read it is to recover a past long lost. Making the case for the mordant paradigm shift of US morals, ethics and literary tastes, this is the marker past which one can see the sad decline of the quality of art and life in the modern world. I cannot improve on the highly intelligent and sensitive overview given here by reviewer Big Orange ""paxbear"" and so will not review the book in detail. That it is one of only three Saroyan volumes still in print makes the case for the obsolesence of the clear heart and clear mind in today's mindlessly kinetic world. You can read this book in the time it would take you to go see MI 111 in a cineplex. Carpe diem. Read this instead",positive
"My husband and I recently bought a home and I really felt I needed to find some tips on being organized.  I used to be very organized (and still am at work), but with the birth of my daughter almost a year and a half ago that has all gone down hill around the house.  I came away with some really good tips for organization.  Not to mention some good tips on how to get rid of ants and various other insects and rodents.  Great book for any mom who feels their house needs a little boost in the organization department",positive
"This book if very well done, it has diagrams that not only are clear but  also easy to follow, the photos are outstading, the selecction of models  are just rigth.   I will recomend it for everyone that is interesting in  Origami and as a good gift for a family",positive

"I first read about this wonderful book on one of the services that provides reading guides for book clubs.  I was intrigued by the premise, and knew I had to buy it.  This is one book that did not let me down!  I was captivated from the moment I began.  I read in greed, hungering for the next diary entry.  I completed it much too quickly, and had to re-read some entries.  I found myself wondering about some of the women.  (Many are still on my mind.)  I am so pleased that book two is in the works.  This is a book that is too good to miss. ",positive
"As always the latest compilation in this annual science fiction anthology remains one of the great anthologies as the current entries are top rate.  For the most part, the thirty contributions are superb tales from a who's who of the genre.  Especially fascinating is Paul McAuley's creative entry ""The Two Dicks,"" in which Philip K. Dick writes mainstream fiction until he meets Richard Nixon.  Other stories are well written as Gardner Dozier scores again with selections that run the gamut from alternative realties to artificial intelligence to ""animal"" intelligence that worms its way into the reader's mind.  The introduction by Mr. Dozier provides a ""Summation"" of the trends in the year, which can be summarized as ""stable"".  Science fiction fans who appreciate shorts will devour this must reading that once again lives up to its title.",positive
"Stephen Hawking has crafted a masterpiece that requires only two qualities of the reader: patience and an open mind.  For those willing to take the (often substantial) time required to digest the material and accept (or even challenge) it, a awe inspiring world awaits.  This book is rightfully one of the best selling books of all time, and a must read for anyone who has any interest in the world around them",positive

"Thankfully, this is NOT littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies, the hallmarks of 99% of the latest-and-greatest business books. Especially since it was written in 1999, Moore's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry. He was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005. The book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though, and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy, rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation.

I loved this book. I really am into those old school ways for children and this is the book. I think we need to discipline this generation the way our parents did us.

"I would agree with the translator that Imitation of Christ ranks very close to the Bible. I read it over and over. It is shocking clear and concise.

"Only knowing Jack Canfield from the very successful ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" mega series, I had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach.  Although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success, the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life.  This lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit.  Lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions.  A absolute must read book for understanding the real you",positive
"Since I received this book I have been carting it around, using it for reference ever since. I wish that I had been introduced to this book sooner in my college career; it sets a good foundation for the basics. It is also good for sparking ideas if you are stuck. Robin Williams also writes well, making it a fun, easy read (like all her books).",positive
"I, too, have an MA in American History, and I was never given reason to think about each of two questions raised by this important book. Firstly and fundamentally, what was the timetable by which the British military were expected to leave the former colonies, and, second, what ""property"" could they take with them, especially as ""property"" had a very particular meaning here in the new nation?

"Be aware that the reviews for a book are displayed not only for one edition, but for all editions under the same title.  The Oxford Philosophical Texts edition of Hume's ""Treatise"" should be the standard student edition. The Prometheus Books edition is cheap, but it does not include a modern introduction or any study notes. I recommend the Oxford Philosophical Texts version if you want or need more than just the raw text",positive
"Thirty years later and this classic remains a compelling read. This book has fueled a thousand others, setting the perspective for all those interested in the building blocks of life. It's a genes-eye-view of where we came from and how we are motivated, a science and reason-based treatise that is compulsory reading for those of us intent on learning from and about our remarkable natural history. Other books by Dr. Dawkins maybe an easier read but this is where it all started",positive
"Gaylife on the English countryside is like everywhere, you never know when your BF (boyfriend) gets bored with you. The battle with London's competitive nightlife makes you reguarly ask yourself: &quot;What have I to offer&quot;? The efforts to entertain your BF are as tiresome as the question how organize your own life so it won't get dull. And once you got things fixed you yourself run into this willing guy.  The tragicomedy the Spell tells the story of four men, Robin, the ageing architect who enjoys his life together with his younger BF Justin, a witty layabout, Robin's son Danny, a georgeous body dealing in superficiality and Justin's former lover Alex, a well-mannered young man in search for consistency. To find out if they all get what they want is a truly delicious way to spend your time. The story is written out of the perspective of all leading parts and therefore very nicely ballanced. Hollinghurst is gifted with a great sense of attentiveness. His characters show many different moods caused by tiny events. Every self-assured attitude is merciless exposed. I recognized myself and my friends many times without realizing this ever before. It made me smile and reassured me. I think this is Hollinghurst's most post-modern novel. Unlike the Swimming-Pool Library's sexual odyssee this is a splintered glimps into life and how down to earth it can be",positive
It's easy to realize once again what makes Garth Ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading this one. Throughout the story I was unable to predict what was going to happen on the next page. And despite Ennis making this into a rollercoaster ride he still keeps it all believable. ,positive

"It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier.  I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the ""awful"" German language was hilarious.  In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing.  The scene ""riding"" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face.  It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or ""typical"" American's attitudes today.",positive
"Jonathan Glover's book is not quite like anything you've read on war, state terror, and genocide.  The tour of twentieth-century horrors is thematic rather than chronological, organized according to the ethical issues Glover wants to explore.  This takes a little getting used to, but it allows the author to jump, for example, from the First World War to the Cuban Missile Crisis, to see which lessons had been learned in the interim and which might be applied in the future.  The cumulative power of Glover's pointillist technique is enormous.  &quot;Humanity&quot; combines a clear-eyed (necessarily often gruesome) depiction of *in*humanity with an informed and enlightening discussion of how leaders and ordinary people can change things for the better.  As an examination of the psychological and existential origins of mass murder and genocide, it marks an advance on Ervin Staub's classic &quot;Roots of Evil,&quot; and should be of interest to any student of modern history and politics",positive
I recommend this book highly for anyone who is losing a close family member or friend to illness or who has lost someone and just are having a hard time coming to terms with why,positive

In fact there is something in this book for everyone no matter what your relationship with your father is or was. The most precious things a father can provide are time, attention, and love.  This book makes the reader sit back and appreciate the little things only you and your dad know. Great work! Keep it up, Tim!  -- I also watch most of Tim's TV programs.",positive

"His basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United States is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs.",positive

"The late Carl Sagan was one of the most popular, influential, and successful interpreters of astronomy to the American public. In 1973 he published &quot;The Cosmic Connection&quot;. He offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science, inspiring a generation of scientists and non-specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general, and astronomy in particular. Now Cambridge University Press has reissued a new edition of Sagan's influential book, enhanced with Freeman Dyson's commentary on Sagan's vision and on the importance of &quot;The Cosmic Connection&quot;; Ann Dryan's assessment of Sagan's cultural significance as a champion of science; and David Morrison's discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of Sagan's predictions. Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection is &quot;must&quot; reading for all Sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence",positive
Perhaps the long shadow of Francis Parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the French and Indian War (Seven Year's War).

Author Carol Rinzler's light and humorous discussion ranges from a concise description of what cholesterol is, to many of the different approaches to lowering cholesterol and why ""target"" values for cholesterol can differ in different people. There's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like Atkins', Sugar Busters, and Protein Power -- pluses and minuses of each.",positive
"This book is a very detailed starting point for Renaisance fans. At its heart this is a socio-economic history. The clever inclusion of climate and geographic conditions presuasively explained why prosperous Capitalism grew in some regions while others remained stagnant. Chapter 5-""The Human Unit"" was the most informative. Most facets of history are here for the reader to absorb. This is the type of book we all wished we had in school",positive
"This book is simply incredible.  A more stimulating book I couldn't  imagine!  It's not that it told me so much I didn't know intuitively, but  seeing it written so distinctly in black and white really hit home.  This  is one to read if you really want to get a sense of just how dramatically  the world has changed.  Neal Gabler, tells it like he sees it and has a lot  of research to back up his views.  I love that he doesn't make judgements  or try to press an opinion on the reader.  It's left up to you to decide  how you feel about it all.  I find myself thinking of points he brought up  throught the day and seeing just what he meant by experiencing it in  &quot;real&quot; life.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I  wish it was a bit MORE in-depth.  It's so engaging that I can imagine an  entire college course being made from this book.  It is a book that's as  entertaining as it is informative, and that's the whole point",positive

I would have liked additional coverage of digital SLRs, but I have found that elsewhere, and still prefer Complete Digital Photography's treatment of the broader topics",positive

"I can not put into words what this journal of the truth has done for me as a African-American Male living in the United States of America.  I was introduced to this book by a man of Guyanese decent who knew I needed to read this book.  I have to admit it was a difficult read because my primary education only spoke of American History and there was no mentioning of any African-Caribbean contributors from the ""Middle Passage"" period.  Now, at thirty-nine many things are clearer to me.  ""Roots"" and ""Beloved"" are historic, well-documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race, creed or color.  To make sure what I read had some semblance of truth while in Puerto Rico I visited a sugar mill in Guanica and my heart just melted.  If you read the book you will understand my feelings.  I became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of American children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from Africa, South America, The Caribbean, Asia, United States and Europe.  Eric Williams I know I can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken ""Thank You""!

Anything you purchase in the Left Behind Series is an excellent read.  These books are great and very close to the Bible.  I have the entire set.  Amazon is a great shopping site and they ship fast.

"David Baldacci has a knack for writing fiction that sucks you in and holds you no matter what the story.  Part of the talent is to introduce interesting characters.   This book is no exception.

Michael asks Sara to marry him but Sara really loves Michael's brother John, who Sara has only seen once and never officially met.",positive
"Carl Hiaasen spins a tale of adventure and humor that should motivate young readers to protect wildlife and natural resources. Hoot is set in the seaside town of Coconut Cove. The plot revolves around Mother Paula's Pancake House, a fictitious restaurant chain in Florida about to build its 100th store on a parcel of land inhabited by families of burrowing owls. The developers know about the endangered owls and removed legal evidence of the owls from public records. Unwary citizens applaud Mother Paula's in Coconut Cove. ",positive
"This book still does not address many areas I find interesting in James Brown's career but I find it a natural companion to the three other JB books in my collection: Cynthia Rose's ""Living In America: The Soul Saga Of James Brown""; Geoff Brown's biography ""James Brown""; and ofcourse, the Brown/Tucker ""The Godfather Of Soul - James Brown"". All three dig deep into this metaphysical musician's mind but this one has a stronger narrative, a bit less guarded: his late '80s fall is described in a more contrite way, for example. His scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue - but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men, then immediately moves on to the next thought. Even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality, obviously directed at the female fans, ever recorded. Similarly, his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap/hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self-righteous: there is alot of ""adult"" content in his catalogue which can't be explained away as ""art"". However, fans can trace his development into more ""cerebral"" music, with more and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being produced  from the late '60s on.",positive
"The story is both true and extremely unique: The Author, who is an Austrian mountaineer and a SS Nazi officer at the same time,  escapes from a British POW camp in India with the goal to go through Tibet to Japan-occupied Burma, to be sent back to Germany, so as not to miss his chance to participate in WWII.  The extreme difficulties of hiding from officials and surviving the wintry elements of the Himalaya mountains make his Burma plan impossible, so he stays in Tibet.  His unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the ""Forbidden City"" (Lhassa, the capital), gaining employment in the Tibetian Government, becoming a friend of the ""God-King"" Dalai Lama - an extremely bright, knowledge-hungry teenager, and learning the Tibetian language to the degree which anable him to do live interpretation for Dalai Lana of English-language movies (""Believe me, it is not easy for a German to translate Shakespearian English into Tibetian"").

"I have to give Philippa Gregory a big THANK YOU! for approaching this story from a different perspective from The Other Boleyn Girl.  It delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of English royalty and wealth.  Again I was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events.  There were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end, I was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book.  So if you are deciding whether or not you'd like to read this after having read The Other Boleyn Girl, I greatly encourage you to do so, you won't regret it",positive

"I just recently discovered an interest in philosophical thought, and I found myself overwhelmed by all the resources available to me.  I had no idea where to start when I stumbled across The Philosophy Gym.  Nothing could have been more appropriate.  It dives right into all the hot topics and gave me some foundational knowledge about how to approach those issues from a logical standpoint.  It introduces the reader to basic philosophical terminology as well as several of the great historical philosophers and their famous arguments.  Each topic is brilliantly presented in nice bite-sized chunks with suggestions for further reading at the end of each chapter.  I couldn't be more pleased with this intro to philosophy",positive

It was complete in that it discussed the men, tactics, weapons, and terrain in the southern campaign.  Not only was this book a great souce for the southern war but it also gave good insight into the revolutionary war in general.  If you're interested in this topic and want to increase you're knowledge of the southern war, get this book.  It's informative as well as pleasing to read",positive

"&quot;Those who write well have more power and therefore have more control over their lives&quot; (p.21).  If this is indeed true then Mem Fox is a very powerful woman!  In the midst of the phonics vs. whole language war being raged in the media, this book is a call for reading and writing teachers to examine their practices and strive for truly purposeful, artful teaching.  Fox's insights into her life as a writer, teacher and mother make this a truly inspiring and intensely challenging read.  I have always believed that to be an effective reading teacher, I must be a reader, able to share my passion for books with my students, but Mem Fox points out that unless I am a writer as well, I will be unable to know the difficulties, fears, hopes and needs of my students as writers.  I plan to thoughtfully explore the forms of writing I use, examine the writing process I go through and share my writing with my students on a more regular basis.  I am convinced that we will all grow from the experience!",positive
"Frazee's comical ""Guide for Babies of All Ages"" has a subconscious message behind the humor, meanwhile encouraging those first few steps that will open up a universe of new experiences, baby leaving the shelter of the familiar for the unknown. The roly-poly baby illustrated is tiny compared to everything around him, objects taller than him, but once he pulls himself up and begins that first, tentative journey, it is impossible to stop. Of course, there are a few cautions along the way, ""be careful of things that are wobbly; stay away from fragile stuff"". There are the usual setbacks, too-much too-soon and a tumble to the floor, followed by a howl and the effort to being again. Cleverly worded and cheerfully illustrated, this tongue-in-cheek guide is a delight, offering more food for thought than is first apparent. Luan Gaines/ 2006.",positive

"Set in Venice at the end of World War II, Hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old American colonel and Renata, a young and very pretty Italian contessa.  Loss is a recurring theme--the death of many of the Colonel's subordinates in combat, the break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman, and the severe injury to one of the Colonel's hands from which he suffers constant pain.  The Colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short.",positive
"I saw the movie in a theater when it first came out. I was a teenager and, although I believed it to be primarily a girl's movie, I did enjoy it. I've seen it several times since then, and it still has not lost its charm. When I finally did read the book, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow it more closely. To me, these are two different stories. The Holly in the movie is likeable; the novella's Holly is a harpie who cares for no one or nothing else. (When my wife saw the movie, she remarked that Holly was, ""an idiot."") However, the book's storyline is more interesting...more haunting, and the book's ending is more intriguing. The movie ends as a love story. The book is much more. And, oh yes, whatever you may think of Capote as an individual, the guy was a damn good writer",positive
"Always lively and perspicacious, this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why Europeans spread so thickly into North America, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina (the lands Crosby labels ""Neo-Europes""), what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? The question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion, but the European housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from Europe followed suit. Quite often these organisms, even the domesticated ones, raced ahead of European explorers themselves, rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. Why was this so? Why didn't, say, Australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to England, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of Europe? To answer this odd question, Professor Crosby begins his story with Pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. These ""seams of Pangaea"" then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when European mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. Crosby details case after case in each category: weeds, pests, livestock, diseases and crops. He forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. What is the answer? He drops clues every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. Here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the European diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the Old World civilizations--and they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. Together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats, clover, peaches, measles and, yes,  dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries, that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of Pangaea",positive

"The subject provided a good historical perspective on Japan's Renaissance period, post civil wars and pre-westernization. In many respects Musashi, a Ronin represents Japan's search for an identity, a country ruled by military might in the form of the Shogun, yet keeping an Emperor who they revered as a god, a god without power. This Sword Saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel; he was also an artist, a lithographer and an author. Yet, he was masterless, masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer's devotion to his master. He was his own master, in a time when Japan had no voice, serving all, without righteous.

"At first, I found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a Christian and a catechist in the Catholic Church. Yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story, especially since I work as a mental health professional. As I keep reading, I discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope, of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child, and of the intrusive nature of the media. I particularly liked the strength Mariah showed during this conflict, despite her past history of nervous breakdown. And I like the way the character of Ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. The secondary characters were all wonderful, in particular Mariah's mother and the lawyers on both side. I thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story. ",positive
"This book covers in depth the LBO of RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s. Recommended to me by an investment banker friend that knew I wanted to go into M&A work, I decided to read it. I thought the book was excellent, but maybe unnecessarily long. The authors were meticulous in explaining everything about the deal and those involved - from the history to every single meeting and telephone conversation. The two authors never mentioned whether they were present during every conversation or not, but did an incredible job at recreating all that happened nonetheless. For someone interested in pursuing a top Wall Street job, this book is a must. For everyone else that just likes good non-fiction, this book does a superb job at representing the greed of an era",positive
"Noah Webster's book is fascinating reading for today's students and teachers alike, as well as for the average citizen, as there is much to learn from it.  While it may be inappropriate to resurrect it as an  official school text, it certainly has a place in every school library.   One of the most notable features is the comprehensive phonetic system used,  with diacritical marks (accents) applied to all relevant vowels and  consonants; words are divided according to syllables and stress.  It also  spells the names of letters of the alphabet; something which tends to be  ignored in modern teaching.  The terminology of traditional grammar is  used, and there are copious word lists, with words grouped according to  common factors. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to all  students of the English language for the above reasons and for many other  interesting aspects (now-archaisms:thy/thou...; foreign words and phrases;  abbreviations explained; punctuation; etc).  This book should remain a  spelling classic",positive

He was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005.

"It doesn't sound like the people you list as reasons ""not"" to read this book, actually read ""this"" book. There is a big difference, in my opinion, of putting positive affirmations in your mind, versus a witch doctor. And quite honestly, it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in ""conjuction"" with medical care. Does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care, because you will most definitely be healed? No where. So in my opinion, one has to have a ""sound"" mind, and not view the book as a ""cure all"" for all the ills in life, but rather a positive way to ""enhance"" your life. It is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care, when you have a terminal illness, or any other illness for that matter. But according to what I gather from the book, you CAN use positive affirmations, and ""believe"" that you are getting well, to help keep yourself in a positive state, rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well. Studies aside from this book have PROVEN that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook, have done wonders for recovering patients, along with their medical care. Your review did not address any of those people that read this book, because the two examples of people you list, it is apparent they didn't read the book either, (not sure what compelled you to post here?) therefore you are not qualified, in my opinion, to critique this book, as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist, did they prescribe drinking snakes blood, too? Anyway, this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick, and those that do, probably won't be addressing their medical problem. Can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis? I imagine it can, (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical treatment. Anyway, you might want to actually read the book, instead of making comments of what happened to ""so and so"" who didn't even read it or apply it, including yourself.",positive

It IS over a decade old now, and I don't think it is intended as a source for scholars of English. But, for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read. I can't compete with some of the above reviewer's scholarly points, but I don't think replacing some of Bryson's dogma with their own is worthwhile. Mother Tongue is a great starting point and very educational. ""Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words"" is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me.",positive
I read Desperation and enjoyed it immensely much like i did with The Regulators also. This book is filled with suspense from page one. The book never drags in my opinion. This book though is not for the faint of heart. If you don't enjoy high body counts and gore then you will not like this book and will most likely put it down by the second chapter. But if you don't mind it at all like me you will enjoy the suspense he gives you and the twists and turns this book takes. The ending is by far the most suspenseful part. I also recommend reading Desperation first because you will probably understand it better and get a better look on what Tak is all about. The journal entries and newspaper articles are a very nice touch to the story and it lets you understand what is going on alot better also. I wish there was a part three to this but sadly there isn't. I can't choose between Desperation and Regulators because their both great but The Regulators does have the more suspenseful end to it. Although it is alot bloodier and may you even get a brief lump in your throat like i did when a tragic thing happens in the end. Keep up the good work King,positive

"I was a little wary about the title but this was not at all about weight gain and/or loss; weight was incidental. In this fiercely intelligent novel, Dorothy and Justine are both desperately lonely women, both victims of abuse, and yet are different in other ways. Their parents often failed them, their childhood was often full of shame and self-sabotage, but Gaitskill writes this with complexity, always aware that a victim can also be a victimizer. Gaitskill is never sentimental. Underneath her narrative, underneath the pain and the sex scenes (which are never fully loving) and the disappointments and loneliness, is a raging anger at the inability of human beings to connect - on race, on class, but mostly on gender. I sensed that Anna Granite, the intellectual whose shadow dominates this narrative, and who is the reason Dorothy and Justine first meet, is Gaitskill's platform for displaying her keen intellect; and sometimes there is a hint of didactism. But this is a minor quibble. The last section moved me very much and proved that although Gaitskill abhors sentimentality, she can certainly do sentiment well. `Humanity' is a word often found in this book. Our sexuality is connected to our humanity. Our ability to treat other human beings like human beings is what makes us human. In the end, Gaitskill's brilliant, wonderfully feminist novel was, for me, about how easily we strip each other of our humanity.",positive

"Firstly, I have not seen the film adaptation of 'Single White Female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other.  This book, about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written is very easy style.  Characterizations, prose, and dialogue are all straightforward.  I can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.  And the book's ""feel"" is anything but original.  'Sliver' by Ira Levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in Manhattan for a single, white female.  Still, 'Single White Female' is an entertaining read.",positive
"Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.  ",positive
"Malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail.  I really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books.  He almost makes the process seem easy, and maybe it is, IF you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant.  However, much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a ""plateau'ed"" or ""downward spiraling"" church that has been around for 100 years.  The principles are easy and make sense IF you have 100% support of the congregation.  That's pretty hard to do in most of the churches I've been in that need strategic planning the most.

"This is a charming little book.  It's very concise, profusely illustrated, and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids.  It delightfully summarizes the work of Plato/Theaetetus, Archimedes, Euclid, Kepler, and Euler in only 57 pages, half of which contain only illustrations.  As a model-builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra, I was a little concerned when I looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about ""sacred geometry.""  Fortunately (at least from my point of view) it does not contain a word about it, except for a cursory reference to the elements Plato associated with each of the Platonic Solids.  A table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge/radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids--all the info a model builder needs!  This book won't impress anyone with a mathematics background, but for a layman like me, it's a perfect introduction.  Kudos to Sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format",positive
"In this book, Dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history.  He focuses primarily on the Catholic church.  From Dulles' analysis, there are five basic ways to understand the church.  He explores how these models have been used over time, as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses.  In the rest of the book, Dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology.  He has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five.  My only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward.  Rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models.  The book is helpful, however, to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church.  It is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church.  All things considered, this book is an asset to pastors, students, and anyone involved in ministry",positive
"i read this years after i'd read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it wasn't as rewarding as the first two books were. maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style. i dunno. i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story. i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff, j.d. salinger's the man",positive
I'm amazed that people didn't like this book more... I am also a Land Arch student who had it as an assigned book that was rarely actually assigned.  I was thumbing through it in hopes of generating ideas for another class and was amazed at the amount of usable information it contained.  Perhaps it is better digested in chunks instead of the whole.  I found it great as a reference book,positive

"Dave Barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from The Miami Herald.  There is a huge margin in difference of quality in Boogers are My Beat than in his initial non fiction books such as Dave Barry's Bad Habits.  Boogers are My Beat is one of those rare books that once you start turning the pages you don't want to put down until the back cover.  Dave Barry educates his fellow man on a diverse range of topics such as why you can't use the towels hanging in the bathroom, the Salt Lake City Olympics, babies on airlines, North Dakota, Bear in the Big Blue House and cell phones to name just a few.

"Tony Nourmand's &quot;Film posters of the 60's&quot; is a wonderful and  colorful coffee table style book that is a great treat to look through.  There are many of the classic film poster images of the French New wave,  the films of Stanley Kubrick and the classic 007 posters, just to name a  few. Film poster collecting is a great adventure and this book reflects  that enthusiasm. This book was lovingly organized with great detail. A  superb value! Looking forward to future editions",positive

"Elaine Pagels is a wonderful writer.  Her explanation into early Christianity is wonderful.  It is definitely worth the time to read this.  She delves into the politics of the early church, the Passion, the resurrection, as well as the clashes between Gnostic and Orthodox thinking.  Too often, we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available.  She just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another.  If you want to get an idea of who the Gnostics were, read this",positive

Great life lessons as well as cultural lessons in this book",positive

"They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a ""fact-checker"", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking.  For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars",positive
"As China re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century, much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world. Oddly, the fascism of the Communist regime remains largely in place in the era following Mao's disastrous reign, even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge, heavily-populated, and (from a Western perspective)oftentimes strange land. Aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of Christianity in China, as well as introducing readers to the many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country. On a recent trip to China, I was highly impressed by the deep generosity, humility, resourcefulness, strength, perseverance, and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all ages. This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith. This spirit is also, I believe, one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many Chinese. Also, those who are concerned that a ""Christian China"" would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a Westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy. It seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly Chinese way",positive

This book not only can be applied to the work place but  in your life at home, family, friends, and children.  This book has helped  me greatly",positive
"Here's a good litmus test to show how good a book like ""Breathing Lessons"" is--nothing extraordinary happens and yet I did not want to put the book down.  There are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret.  There are no car chases, explosions, sex scenes (barely even any kissing), or exotic locations.  No one changes or has an epiphany.  Almost NOTHING happens--Maggie and Ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all.  To the average reader this book probably would seem really dull.  Heck, if someone told me the plot of this book I'd think it was really dull too, but I didn't want to put it down.",positive
"I just love this book. It's for anyone who practices no particular ""religion"". The prayers are simple, in every day language, easily understood like God is speaking right to me.

"I've been a fan of Carol Dweck's scholarly work for years. Her work on self-esteem, self-concept, and the incremental vs. entity theories of intelligence provides some of the most powerfully useful tools I've encountered for educators and parents in their work with children, as well as in their own self-awareness and lives. I'm delighted to see this information written here in such a user-friendly conversational tone, rich with stories that illustrate the nuances and complexities of Dweck's research and ideas. I'm recommending this book to all of my graduate students (teachers and principals working with gifted learners), as well as to parents of high-ability children.",positive

And if you haven't read ""Caught Stealing"" and ""Six Bad Things"", head to Borders now so you can read them before ""A Dangerous Man"".

"This text was assigned reading in a Psych101 back in 1970, but its themes have stayed with me so strongly I am now ordering it for my personal library.  I was born with a club foot, and experienced the power of being  different, even though my personal defect was so minor as to be rarely  noticed by others.  STIGMA gave me an appreciation of the force behind my  own shame and the reaction to my difference of others.  More importantly, I  learned about the degrees of identity-- which differences make the most  difference (sex, race, disabilities...) and the increasing intensity that  comes with breaking the most closely held norms.

"In all the talk about education issues these days, it's easy to forget that what's really important is the relationship, the energy, between students and teacher.  When the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids--THAT'S where it's at.  It's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum--it's what happens between PEOPLE in a classroom.  This book shows that dynamic relationship between eager, active kids and a caring, active teacher.  It's not all pleasant, and successes are sometimes small, but a pervasive caring underlies it all.  As a teacher, this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing I can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork, go for a walk, go to bed early so I can be there for them the next day",positive

"This unforgettable story illustrates the crazy, life-changing adventure of a seventeen-year-old boy who struggles to let go of his fading childhood and accept the phoniness of the adult world. Holden Caulfield's loneliness and lack of motivation combined with a traumatic childhood cause him to leave behind his youthful days at Pencey Prep to venture into the dynamic adult world of New York City. Holden tries to hide his youthful innocence as he mirrors the habits of other adults, going to bars, drinking, and purchasing prostitutes. However, his bickering and sarcastic attitude suggest a hidden desire to stay young, a desire he stubbornly buries beneath his new, mature lifestyle. Holden, like many others, longs to live in a place that is simple and motionless, a place where one needn't worry about the past or the future. Holden also hopes to preserve the innocence in others, such as his sister, so they don't turn out like him, depressed and regretful. Through Salinger's vibrant attitude towards Holden's experience in New York, we readers learn to stop running from our past to prevent losing our youth altogether. The Catcher in the Rye has survived generations as one of the world's best bildungsromans, not because it illustrates the fading youth and growing maturity of a memorable character, but because it demonstrates the confusion of a character as he fights desperately to protect what remains of his childhood",positive

"The novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the Arthurian legends. They are, in fact, historical fiction at its best. Whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy, but to weave the stories into historic events. The first six novels in the series (that is all I have read, though it appears that there are two or three more) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the Arthurian legend. But the beauty of the books is in Whyte's prose. A Scottish poet, he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours.",positive

The check for the fee bounces and Kinsey is now looking for the man who gave it to her, plus the young man she is to give the cashier's check to.  Everything she finds out about her client is bad.  He is a drunk, who has killed several people in a car wreck, and appears to be a bigamist.  When he is found dead, Kinsey has plenty of suspects including survivors of the dead motorists and two angry wives.  This book is written in Grafton's usual breezy style, and Kinsey becomes more independent and more likeable with each book.  I would recommend the whole series to mystery-lovers",positive
"You'll never read this in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and NG is all the poorer for it.  P.J. O'Rourke is never politically-correct and he visits places on the planet from which most people would like to escape...the result is a spot on, razor sharp, keenly observed travelogue that is side-splittingly funny, in a tragic sort of way.  O'Rourke has a wonderful way of spotting irony, silliness, and official absurdity, and letting all of the air out of pompous, ill-conceived notions.  In short, he is the UN's worst nightmare.  For anyone who has travelled or ever interacted with any government agency anywhere--especially our own--this book is a must read",positive
"Companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth: More teams mean more meetings. Management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork, but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long, sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed. With teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world, meeting management, or facilitation, is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions. Author Ingrid Bens' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting. A host of charts, examples and worksheets (not to mention the accompanying CD) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome. We [...] recommend this hands-on how-to guide to anyone motivated to minimize the waste of meeting-creep",positive

"This is a cleverly constructed book of several parts and a few recurring motifs. Jones, a Welsh Methodist, Everton FC supporter, London hack and Oxford (Arts?) graduate, goes to live in Parma, Italy where his beloved has established herself. He divides his book into nine separate chapters and tries to weave them together as well as his excellent English and his motifs will allow. The first chapter discusses nuances of the Italian language and he uses those nuances to propound that Italy is a much more nuanced country than England and that its culture is infinitely more refined. An entire chapter brings the nuances of Italian culture to bear on football and he waxes very lyrical about the local youth and whatever immigrants are around playing ball as the sun goes down. The football allows us to place Italian village life in our minds and to empathize very much with it.",positive

But not until they were in school, almost always part time and I did not use 'working' as an excuse to not volunteer at school, sports, and generally be in my kids lives. The point is really about your priorities. Do you instinctively put your kids needs first? It's been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area. We have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten; now they are seniors. You can instantly tell which parents were connected, involved and had their priorities straight. Not all of them stayed home the whole time. ",positive

Captain Jim is so sweet and perfect, you can nearly see him. Miss Cornelia is funny and Susan is great. Anne has to deal with tragedy and joy that makes the books so wonderful.

"This book provides a fine introduction to the myths of Northern Europe.  The book examines the few remnants we have in the forms of epic poems and prose, written by Christian writers after the fact - the Eddas, Beowulf, and the Viking sagas.  From these sources, especially the Edda, the author reconstructs the myths and stories relating to the Norse gods and their subsequent twilight in Ragnarok.  Then, the author seeks to answer various questions about this myth and determine whatever relation it may have had to the original religion of the Northern European peoples.  The figures of Odin, Thor, Loki, Balder, and the rest of the Norse gods play an important part in our European cultural heritage and it is nice to see them presented in an introduction as here.  Whatever underlying mental constructs are behind such accounts as that of Ragnarok (the Twilight of the Gods) they certainly appear to be universal to the human race, as revealed in all forms of apocalyptic literature.  Ultimately these beliefs died a rather easy death at the hands of the Christian worldview.  Whatever your personal opinion about the replacement of the pagan beliefs by Christianity and whether or not the pagan beliefs should be resurrected or remain buried, you will certainly profit from reading this book and it will help you to better understand Northern Europe in pre-Christian times.  Finally, it must be noted that in many ways, at least in my opinion, the society of the Vikings was superior to our own.  I admire the strong sense of individualism that the Vikings expressed and enjoy greatly reading about their heroic feats",positive
"This was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the Marian cult. The one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-Christian origins of the Marian cult. Other resources, however, cover  the evolution of the Anatolian fertility cult of Cybele into the Roman  Magna Mater and later into the so-called &quot;BVM&quot;. The author does a  good job of showing the origins of various aspects of Mariology and  contrasting these developments with Christianity in the West. The author  has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the  syncretic process which blended Christianity with various pagan religions  and medeival political structures to create the Roman Catholic Church",positive

"As a librarian and a lover of all things relating to Arts & Crafts style, I recommend this book to anyone desiring a greater knowledge of this furniture's history and design evolution.

"Having read this book as well as Barnet Schacter's on New York during the Revolution, both works I find are flawed in different ways.  The likeable thing about Gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time.  The hard thing to realize about the battle of Brooklyn is that it really wasn't much of a battle.  The author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle.

"This volume contains 152 middle length sutras which are mainly sermons to monks on buddhist practices.  Having compared the Pali original with the translation of about 12 Sutras I would give it a high fidelity rating.  The appendix contains extensive notes which discuss the text from the viewpoint of the Theravada commentaries.  A must read for those who want to learn or study using original source material and do not read Pali.  The introduction contains valuable material on Buddhism by a Bhikkhu long ""gone-forth"".

"A must have for anybody interested in golf course architecture.  As great as Pebble Beach is today, you'll wonder why it was ever changed after seeing the old photos of it following Chandler Egan's work in 1929!  Buy  this beautiful book and you won't be disappointed",positive
"This is a nice compact hardback edition of Dashiell Hammett's five novels, which he wrote between 1929 and 1934. A veteran of Pinkerton detective agency in several cities, Hammett turned his intimate familiarity with crooks, low-lives, and the seedier side of life into hard-boiled, hard-hitting detective stories. This was a time when urban corruption was the rule, and private detectives, journalists, and police officers shared information. Two of these novels, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; are American classics. Another, &quot;The Thin Man&quot;, inspired one of Hollywood's best-loved movie franchises. Hammett's novels lift the veil of propriety from the subcultures in which they take place, laying bare violence, corruption, and pervasive cynicism. But they're not dreary. The sharp prose crackles, and the heroes stand apart from the corruption while swimming in it, steadfast in their own codes of conduct, their iconoclastic ideologies rooted securely in realism. These five novels all appeared as serials in magazines prior to being published as novels. &quot;The Thin Man&quot; appeared first in &quot;Redbook&quot;, the others in &quot;Black Mask&quot;.",positive
"Originally published in the early 1900's, this book is an excellent resource for teaching young men about being their own self in a society that is trying to mold them into another copy.

"As a former history major and teacher I am very familiar with the history of the Crusades from the Western point of view.  They have been portrayed in literature, movies, and history.  They have been glamorized and vilified by Westerners for centuries.  Reading Amin Maalouf's rendering of this familiar story from the view-point of Arab chroniclers was like looking through Alice's looking glass at a world that is backwards from the one we know.  Here we don't have just Crusaders, advernturers, or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray, but invaders, barbarians, and enemies of God Himself.  ",positive

"An amazing resource to the odd world of Chick collecting.  Mr. Fowler has crafted an exhausting, almost overwhelming guide to all of Chick's works and articles about him.  Everything is cross-referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information.  Minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter.  The book (presented in a distinctive computer printout style, possibly due to its origins as a self-published work) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers.  But even casual Chick fans will enjoy the &quot;History of the World&quot; segment, which ties all of Jack's wild theories into a cohesive narrative, and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia (there's a list of every instance of the term &quot;haw&quot; for instance).  Each tract and comic is described, and info is given on various parodies and rip-offs.  This is a must for all Chick fans (both &quot;saved&quot; and otherwise)",positive

"I love this book--it's beautiful. This book is a delightful romp through the farmyard, with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly, causing the ruckus with all the animals. The abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and, therefore, may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck, the kittens in the hayloft, the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. But a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing Fleming's gorgeous art each time. My nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. I highly recommend this book",positive

The twists and unpredictable turns make the book a truly unforgettable experience.  You don't need to be a golfer or a fan of golf to enjoy this novel.  Can lightning strike twice?  Absolutely",positive
An excellent short introduction to the philosophy of logical atomism. The  lectures should be read along with Wittgenstein's Tractatus  Logico-Philosophicus.

"Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland has always been preoccupied with three very important things: dancing, dressing, and reading sensational novels. But doing these things won't get you a husband, or acquaint you with other young ladies, such as yourself. So, upon request from a neighbor, Catherine is invited to spend some time in Bath - a fashionable town, where Catherine will have the opportunity to interact with people of her own age and stature, who are not related to her. And that is where the naive Catherine meets up with the Thorpe family. Quickly becoming friends with Isabella Thorpe, Catherine begins spending much of her time with the illustrious, yet conniving family. And it is only when Catherine is rescued by Henry Tilney, along with his charming sister, Eleanor, and whisked off to their ancestral home, known only as Northanger Abbey. There, Catherine's choice of reading material - mysteries and ghost stories, that is - comes back to haunt her; for Northanger Abbey is victim to terrible noises in the night - such as creaking, and frightening winds, that leave Catherine feeling as if she is residing in a haunted place herself. The fact that the enormous house is filled with various locked doors, and a curious history only heightens young Catherine's suspicions, and makes her question what mystery and secrets are lurking within Northanger Abbey, and the Tilney family, in general.",positive

"I wrote this review because I felt that none of the reviews so far really got the main cause of this book. This is NOT a book about cosmology (as people would expect from Roger Penrose). In this tiny book, Penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by mathematical processes (something much different from the opinion of 99,99% of neurobiologists, such as Steven Pinker). This view is near to the Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann. The book is easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories (thus, the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works!). Some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they didn't had in mind that this book is about Penrose's point of view on intelligence. In fact, I'm not a physicist, nor a biologist, simply a high school student and I found the book very easy to understand, although I do not agree with Penrose's point of view. I think he forgot something very important. Read it and read the other point of view and you'll find what it is! :",positive

"An incredible task carried aout by two prominent researchers in the field. Arato and Cohen accomplished a great job in this work. The reader both will find a lucid theoretical evaluation of the concept of 'civil society' and will have a better understanding of twentieth century political philosophy. Also, the book does not only 'summarize' the basic arguments and debates about 'civil society'; but also offers a new understanding of our social and political world by their genuine model. As a researcher in the field I do really appreciate their effort and thank these two brilliant researchers for their fastidious and meticulous work.",positive
"Not many writers can characterize children realistically. Somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff. This is definately not one of those novels. Carson mcCullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters, F. Jasmine and John Henry West. I really cannot think of another story, maybe, A Good Man is Hard to Find, by Flannery O'Conner, where the writer can get inside the mind of a child; evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease. John Henry West is one of the most well rounded and well written children I have ever read, and that is a great homage to her writing ability. ",positive

"After talking to several pharmaceutical reps I know, I decided to shoot for a sales rep job myself. This book gives some very good insight into what it takes to land a job in the industry, what kind of people you'll be dealing with, what the hiring pricess is like (with particular emphasis on the interviews), and then what the job is like for people who manage to get hired. I'm very glad that I took the time to read this book because, after finishing it, I realize that being a pharmaceutical sales rep sounds like one of the most horrible careers imaginable. Obviously this is simply my own opinion, and I know there are plenty of people out there who enjoy this kind of work, but nearly every single thing about it, from the superficial way applicants are screened, to the shameless pandering that sales reps must do on the job, sounds simply awful to me. If you are considering a career as a drug rep, you should definitely do your homework to make sure it's really something you would enjoy. This book may very well convince you that you would love it. If so, that's great, and I hope you are successful. But if this kind of work is not right for you, this book can be equally helpful because you'll find out by reading it what the job is really like.

I am a prekindergarten teacher. This book is a favorite of all of my students both boys and girls.  The story has an important moral that all children can learn from.

"I'm sure most people will come to Fitzgerald through her novels, so I have to excuse myself as a first time reader who just happened to pick up these short stories.  I still haven't decided if I enjoyed the collection, but they are unique.  I thought the first story was by far the best, but after that, the quality varied widely.  Unlike a classic short story writer (someone like Guy de Mauppassant), these stories have NO resolution for the most part.  In fact, they leave you with that feeling of listening to music and waiting to shift back into the  major key.  Discordant is the word I'm looking for.  The settings take the reader all over the globe and across three different centuries.  I suspect most would enjoy her novels more (I am certainly heading in that direction to read them next), but I can't say since I haven't read them myself.  Overall, I found this collection a bit unsettling, but still well written.  I'm sure her fans will enjoy them more than I did on this first encounter",positive

It probably wasn't too much later that someone recogniced that a bunch of arches next to each other would yield an arched ceiling to a room. My guess is that it then took a very long time for someone to recognize that if you made a series of arches in a circle you could make a domed room. But as soon as one was built, I suspect that a priest of some kind looked up and immediately saw that a minature version of the sky had been created, and that an artist could transform this sky into a 'Vision of Heaven.'

"Alliterative Analogies, assertively  assembled, appear aplenty, appropriately, apt and artful, absorbing attention ad infinitum. This could be a fitting summary of Abish's stunningly &quot;now&quot; novel, written almost a quarter of a century ago with a linguistic device concocted between Kabbala and alliteration. Chapter 1 is composed with words beginning only with the letter A, Chapter 2 with A and B and so on until chapter 27, when Z first, then chapter by chapter all other letters, are progressively subtracted. In spite of a scheme tracing back to the beginning of written literature, the novel tells of deeds and characters so surprisingly contemporary, they may have been culled from today's headlines: polysexually inclined thugs hide in Africa after a crime spree, with the Author in pursuit of the woman who betrayed them. Chasing after the thugs from country to country, we are introduced to a ruler queen transvestite, war and genocide, corrupted burocrats and soldiers, rampant corruption in a landscape still in hot air, where sparsely assembled people wollow in African Indolence. All is narrated with poetic detachment, in a dimension between joke and dream that implies social, political and historical commentary with what appears linguistical accidentality: it is just that the words were limited by my artifice, reader, the Author seems to smile. No harm intended. Perhaps: the scenario may have seemed so far fetched in 1974, to have been deemed the product of unabridged fantasy. Great art, when unhindered, relates to the whole of time, in all tenses. While amusing, Abish has managed a ponderous read, which meandering on through verisimilar everyday history of attitudes and practices, inserts deep philosophical reflections as light as the puns enclosing them and extends like a prophecy to contemporary events. Attentive readers will delight in finding the one slip from the add-subtract letter scheme. And wonder: was it accidental? &quot;In order to be perfect, all I lack is a defect&quot; goes an ancient italian folk ironic couplet",positive

"This book is pitched, at least in part, to Linux beginners. But it fails in small, maddening ways when speaking to this audience. After a lot of discussion of disk partitioning and install, page 65 tells you to run the ""man"" command in a shell session. It offers no clue that the only way to terminate a ""man"" command is the letter Q - a completely unintuitive action. So a new user can flounder forever, or at least until they get frustrated and reboot. But I don't mean to slam just this book.

"Billy Collins's original voice is delightfully accessible, often blending comedy and solemnity in one poem, and always with something new to say. The playful tone of these poems can be misleading; whether he is writing about eating a good plate of Osso Bucco or his favorite museum rooms, there is  always a pathos lingering in the silence after the last line. Most  relieving is the absence of pretentiousness or haughty language. This is  simply, as Robert Bly writes in his introduction to the best American poems  of 1999, Collins's skillful ability to &quot;bring the soul up close to the  thing&quot; in every poem. Books such as &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot;  threaten to change the face and purpose of poetry in the 21st century.  Let's hope there is plenty more to come from Billy Collins",positive

She writes from her  heart with honesty,integrity and a clear mind. And although written at a  time of Victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or  judgement.

"The working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology. What is being? Merleau answers in the manner of Lao-Tse, and alludes to something like a divine-feminine at the heart of wild perception. It was said by Sartre in his autobiography &quot;Situations&quot; that after Merleau's mother died who was like a &quot;goddess&quot; to him Merleau returned began the project anew. What is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life.  And in the end, Merleau returns to the very object of his study. You can really feel this descent at the book nears its end. It is, however, an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension. That I assure you",positive

"I'm a big Koontz fan and as is generally the case, I greatly enjoyed this story.  It was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre.  That said, it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book.  It had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of Koontz's other books.  In addition, the ending seemed a little hasty.  Thus I gave it four rather than five stars.  That said, I would gladly recommend it to a friend as I would most any of this author's work",positive
"If you love Ludlum's over-the-top novels (and I do), The Matarese Circle has to be up there with the best. Not all of Ludlum's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated &quot;Oh my God!&quot; declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on aren't as riveting as they could be (the two Bourne sequels suffer from this problem, I think.) But Circle delivers on all fronts. Part One is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between Talienkov and Scofield plays out thrillingly. And these are two of Ludlum's most believably drawn characters; we feel empathy for both, and root for them to join forces from the get-go. Antonia Gravet, the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in Part Two, brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot. One final bonus: some of Ludlum's zestiest minor characters appear in this book, adding to the fun in nearly every chapter.",positive
"This is the author's presentation of the Satipatthana Sutra, the basic sutra on mindfullness. As in all of his works he does the work of a good Dharma teacher very well. He keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student's understanding can arise naturally. There are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the Sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the Sutra in meditation. But this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks. The author gives a good commentary on the Sutra and explains why he translates certain passages, but he also gives the alternate interpretations. ",positive
"This is a great book to have in your collection if you're a fan of blues music and history.  By far, it's not the ONLY book out there.  There are a  number of notable artists this book is missing.  Hopefully, future editions  of this book will begin to fill some of the gaps.  That being said, this is  a very good reference just the same",positive
"Like many of the other reviewers here have already stated, this is a book to be read by everyone!  I am not a reader of westerns but I loved this book.  After 800 pages I was never so sad to see a book end.  ""Lonesome Dove"" has a little of everything, drama, action, humor, and a few love stories to boot.  There are few books that have made me laugh or cry like this book did.  By the time your are done you will have new friends Woodrow, Pea Eye, Claire, Lorena, but especially Gus McCrea.  and you will also have some new villains particularly the frightening Blue Duck.  I can't recommend a book any more than this one",positive
"explodes upon the crime-detective scene. THE HUNDRETH MAN, his first book was excellent and THE DEATH COLLECTORS is as good and even better. Can't wait for the next one!",positive
"This is a very interesting book, particularly on the early restrictionists. It gave me a new perspective on why Americans restricted immigration in the early 20th century, and gave me historical insight into today's immigration policy crisis",positive
"Shadowbred by Paul Kemp is simply an excellent book.  The story is incredibly engrossing, the atmosphere set for each scene is really top-notch, and the journey Paul takes his character's through is really incredible.",positive
This is a GREAT book. Well written and illustrated. This is one of the most hilarious children's books I've read to my child. We were laughing throughout the whole thing.,positive
"I really enjoyed this book. I could pore over the fashions, the interior decoration - it satisfied my desire to see all the details! At the same time, I got a sense of the passage of time in Virginia and Vanessa's lives. Read as a companion to any of Woolf's novels, I think the book would also convey a sense of the writing process.",positive
"I was very impressed to find this very nice book. I've heard about a Quebecois who painted for the popular singer Celine Dion (I'm from Quebec, Canada myself), I wanted to see and I'm very proud of it. Huge ceilings and wonderful murals !  Wow. Felicitations ",positive
"I think the most striking part of this book is that you feel comforted by the fact that the problems you're facing in your own relationships are commonplace. They're not dysfunctional. Every family has its share of issues and you don't need to feel overly guilty for yours. The book's underlying theme is that families that honesty, consideration, character, belief and perhaps above everything else - resilience, can get you through the worst debacles and that at the end of the day it's probably (though not always) worth the effort.",positive

"I'm not a huge fan of this genre of music, but as a very part-time musician, this book was recommended by a fellow friend and musician.  I liked this book alot and found it education and entertaining, even if the subject matter was not of immense interest.  This is definitely not the fault of the author, who did a fine job of making this subject engaging.  ",positive

"Although the photographs are dated, the material is classic.  This book is a must for anyone who is involved with design or review of open spaces.  It shows how people use open space and identifies the common elements of  successful spaces.  While the elements all seem logical, the book shows how  we often fly in the face of logic when using these spaces.  The book  focuses primarily on plazas and small parks in New York City, but includes  a section for smaller cities with low rise buildings.  The information can  also be applied to parks in any size town.  This book is a facinating case  study in social ecology",positive
"From the introduction of basic concepts such as likelihood ratios and predictive values to the simple table format with the always beautiful Netter illustrations, this is the ortho exam text to have.

"The Miernik Dossier was shockingly good. Before this, I had never read anything by McCarry. In fact, I had never even heard the man's name. I was lucky to come across a review of this re-issued work in a magazine. Now I am collecting everything by him.",positive

"Kurzweil opens with a very heartfelt recounting of his return to Judaism and his personal path which led him to Rabbi Steinsaltz. From there the chapters fly by effortlessly, partitioned in small chapters of which each is it's own midrash, giving each of us something to reflect upon and discuss. This is for everyone who wants to know more about not only Steinsaltz, but the beauty and wisdom of the Jewish faith",positive
"In March 2006, there are only three or four books that boast Haskell in their titles.  They are all excellent books.  But the world can benefit from more Haskell books.  In fact, we are in need of such books, especially CS1 texts.  This book is a pleasure to read.  I suspect that even math haters will not find it hostile.  Anyone learning Haskell will find the book and its companion web site a valuable resouce.  On the web site, you will find the source code from the book, such as Powerseries.hs.  You can quickly play and experiment with it; read and learn from it.  ",positive

"As gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, James Herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. Every Living Thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. You will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. If you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. Kudos, James Herriot, you are very much missed",positive
"As a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well, this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises.  It's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears, having first been written in 1856.  But it is practical, clear and encouraging.  It dispells the idea that only certain people can draw.  And by focussing on drawing with pencil, it provides the foundation for using any other media.  A wonderful find",positive
"Dr. Amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family.  The stigma associated with mental illness is deep-seated and difficult to overcome. Understanding the root causes, particularly the genetic predisposition within families, is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life-long problems.  These problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse:  they do not deal with the biological root causes.  Once those are dealt with, the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life.  However, without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions, one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch.  Take my advice.  If the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar, get help as recommended.  You will become a new person, the one you were created to be.  And that is a wonderful thing",positive
"We have used this book as a text for discrete math courses in our undergraduate Computing Engineering and Systems program (University of los Andes, Colombia).

Being a flight attendant myself and looking through the SkyMall magazine countless times on long flights I can tell you...this book is AMAZING. I have never laughed so hard from a book all my life. I really want to get another one and put it in the crew lounge. I'm sure the flight crews will get a kick out of it :,positive
I guess in this book you can see both the good qualities of Ayn Rand as well as some of her non-desirable traits.  Good gateway book before tackling on the big and long Atlas Shrugged,positive
"Pictures via camera reflect not only what the photographer sees, but what he thinks about. The most successful reflect an understanding of things as much as their image, and Jerry Thompson's exploration of the relationship between seeing and thinking in Truth And Photography provides a set of fine duotone photos to illustrate essays reflecting on working photography experiences",positive
This is the best book. I was writing a book about my son who has SI Dysfunction. He is 23 years old now. I was in Barnes and Noble looking for another book when I found this. I was blown away. I never knew there was a book like this. I could have really used this book when Marcus was little. It is so wonderful. I opened it and started reading about my son. My book is called What's Wrong With My Child? Struggling With Sensory Integration Dysfunction. It is only a mother's story of how my child coped with this thing. It is not meant to be a book like Carol Stock Kranowitz's. Her book is wonderful. Anyone who has any questions about their child who has SI Dysfunction. This book is it. Shelly R. Wilso,positive
"I love this book! It is a terrific blend of hand-holding and concrete advice for writers. Each chapter takes the writer/reader through the tough questions we face when we sit down to write: How do we begin? Where do ideas come from? Is there a ritual we can create that will help us begin? I like the fact that I could use this book as a resource. In other words, I did not have to read it cover to cover. Rather, it truly serves as a guide, a mentor's guide, that can serve me as I continue to write. I really liked the movie section,  where Cathleen Rountree uses movies to make points about the writing process.  I found those sections inspirational and useful. If you want to be a writer or if you are already writing, I urge you to Buy this book",positive

"I am an author and journalist and I have to say this is the best novel I have ever read. True to the word ""haunting.",positive
I think that the beginning of the book was the worst part. He started by telling us that he was leaving and wasn't going to tell anyone. He didn't even say goodbye to a lady friend. so he tells us that he's leaving and then he goes back into the past. Back when he was a little kid. He tells about different experiances. how he had to stay in bed for almoxt five years. he tells about all the troubles that his family went through. The end was the best part. i usually hate the endings but this one was good.,positive
"As other reviewers have stated, Ludlum passed away at the time of the publication of this novel. Unfortunately, we may never know what other voice has been mingled with Ludlum's to complete this tale. Honestly speaking, I believe this to be the case because the story is actually better than I have come to expect from Ludlum. No disrespect intended, but I feel this work is actually above his standard.",positive
"A well-crafted comprehensive look at the role of Islam in Turkey. The book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that Turkey has experienced since the 1980s. Specifically, the author mentions the role of opportunity spaces in the evolution of Islamic movements and ideas as a result of economic and political liberalization.I think anyone who is interested in Turkey, Islamic movements, and the relationship between Islam and modernity would get a great deal out of this book",positive
"Having had the delight of living in St. Andrews and traveling over most of Scotland playing golf, Allan's book is the best I have seen, by far, for describing the reality of golf, travel, and living in Scotland. He sugarcoats nothing, his opinion mirrors mine, and he is interested is ensuring his readers know exactly what to expect and know exactly how to best user their time and travel dollars. Even with my Scottish experience and contacts, his book is my golf/travel in Scotland bible.",positive
"What a great account of the nations oldest law enforcement agency.  The book is full of information about the Marshals service, it's mission, and it's history.  You'll also get to know some interesting personalities in  the Marshals service along the way. I am a Deputy Sheriff myself, as well  as a history buff.  From that Perspective, I throughly enjoyed this book  and couldn't put it down.  Mr. Sabbag, thanks for a great look into the  world of the U.S. Marshals. And as for Deputy U.S. Marshal Victor Oboyski -  I'd be happy to &quot;do a door&quot; with you anytime",positive

"I ran into this book accidentally while doing some research. Instead of glancing through it, I ended up reading the whole book. I just couldn't put it off. Content wise, the book doesn't bring me many &quot;light bumb moments&quot;. However, I find it extremely well written rhetorically. While the book is easy to read, it is literarily graceful. I'd suggest everyone to read it--just to enjoy the beauty of language",positive
"This book of eight stories by Virginia Woolf shows Virginia's mind at work demonstrating her &quot;stream of consciousness.&quot; Each story flows from one thought to another asking different questions about life.  For  example, &quot;The Mark on the Wall&quot; questions the meaning of life and  existence.  &quot;An Unwritten Novel&quot; is about what people hide and  what you don't know about a person you seat next to on an  &quot;omnibus.&quot;  All these stories will make you look at life in a  slightly different way",positive
What can I say? More spidey than you can shake a stick at for peanuts.

"This fantastic re-imagining of the Avengers is best consumed in this form. Yes there are too many pop culture references, yes the hulk is a little goofy and the Ultimate Nick Fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but I think once your done with this gigantic, thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about. This story arc takes the Alternate Universe Avengers from their creation to their first major victory, ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good. The second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well. This is the best that the Ultimate universe has to offer, is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers, no inline skates, teen angst, or first love in this one.

"This book provides fascinating details of what life was like for children in Colonial America: How they played, what their education was like, what they wore, etc. The information is drawn from such primary sources as letters, journals and school primers.

"Arrogance by Bernard Goldberg is a truly enjoyable read.  Goldberg doesn't waste time trying to create a vast left wing conspiracy tied to Islam or Communism, he just presents the facts as he sees them.  As a former insider, he's got the dirt on media bigwigs, and he's not afraid to dish.  The liberal bias in the news is causing many people to flee the big three networks and turn on cable to find an escape.  Goldberg offers up several examples of this bias and then goes further by coming up with several suggestions (some tongue in cheek) for correcting this slant.  He also includes surprisingly frank interviews with Tim Russert and Bob Costas.  Goldberg's other books Bias and 100 People Who are Screwing Up America are also excellent reads.  He doesn't attack people on a personal level (although you can tell he has a bit of a grudge against Dan Rather) or use hyperbole or vitriol to get his point across.  Some books written with a conservative slant make you want to throw up your hands and give up on this country, but Goldberg's books don't have that effect.  You can tell he not only loves the country he lives in, but also the profession that he's chosen, and he has hope for the future. ",positive

"Why read a book from 1857 which flopped so badly as commercial literature that Melville stopped writing and ended his career as a customs official? Because this book masterfully explores the entire nature of trust, confidence and cons. Though the setting is a riverboat on the Mississippi River just before the U.S. exploded into Civil War, its insights cross cultural boundaries. ",positive
"I decided to read this on a flight to Indiana from NY.  I managed to complete the book on the return.  It is a quick read, not a self help book, more about Merton and Nouwen finding their true self as well as the author's road to becoming a Jesuit.  I think we all want to find our true self, but not all can and some never attempt to.  Martin stresses the importance of finding our true self in order to achieve happiness that comes from within",positive
"The title of this book is rather deceptive in that you certainly don't need to be adventurous or daring to find this book helpful.  I do sedate landscapes and found his book an excellent guide.  Basically, if you do the least bit of original design in your work - altering an element or two, changing colors around - or if you do whole original works (but haven't actually gone to art school) this book is extremely useful.  It covers the basics of design and color with a focus on the embroiderer or fiber artist.  You can do all the suggested activities in the book in order as a complete design course, or pick and choose sections as needed.  If you wonder why some of your works look great and others look, well, not as great, this book is for you",positive
"Thirty five years ago my high school (Thomas Jefferson, in Federal Way, Washington) held annual competitions in mathematics.  They did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet, just was a few pages long.  There weren't many questions, perhaps a dozen or two (usually in the form of story problems), but they required deep thought and concentration (at least for me).  I still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as I took the ""white book"" and opened it to the first problem.  Several hours later I'd consider myself accomplished if I'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions.  ",positive

"Never Be Sick Again offers a major breakthrough in medical thinking regarding health and disease.  I am a biochemist doing medical research at UCLA. A friend gave me this book to read, and I was very skeptical.  After reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about what it was saying.  I even lost sleep thinking about it.  After many weeks, I have come to a conclusion - the author is right.  There is only one disease and there are only two causes of disease - revolutionary!  Once you understand this simple concept, it changes everything.  If your mind is not closed to new ideas, the profound insights in this book will change your life for the better.  It will give you the power to both prevent and reverse almost all disease.  With this new understanding, from now on, I will approach my research in an entirely different way.  ",positive

"I love these type of memoirs. A person who is not boasting about their skill or having an attitude. Simply shares the love of his work and love of his county. All of James Herriot's books are wonderfull. I was introduced to the children's books a few years ago and just recently started reading his memoirs. Love it, some parts were a bit dry but the books still flowed well and drew you back. Love the depth of scenery and anicdotes about the area. Recommend any book of his",positive

"This is Ann Waldron's best McLeod Dulaney mystery yet. The characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page (and, in some cases, right into your heart).

"A pathbreaking work in women's history and the history of deviancy, this book argues (if not entirely convincingly) for a new interpretation of the history and relationship of girl delinquents and women reformers. Odem  traces the history of middle class women reformers towards sexual  delinquency by young girls through the particularly rich case history of  Los Angeles County. Noting the diverse cultures in L.A. (white, working  class, Hispanic, African-American) Odem argues that many girls who became  labeled &quot;wayward&quot; were acting out against oppressive and  repressive families who held old-fashioned and patriarchal views of girls'  sexuality. Odem also explores the eventually oppressive route that  reformers took in &quot;retraining&quot; wayward girls",positive
"This is the best invertebrate zoology textbook on the market, perhaps the best ever written. The authors are not content to merely present in fine detail the classification, anatomy, physiology, behavior, and ecology of invertebrates, they present alternative interpretations and controversial opinions where these topics are concerned. In that way, invertebrate zoology comes alive as an active, important, and relevant field of study for understanding the ecology and evolutionary relationships of these organisms in a global setting. I highly recommend this book for a course of study or as a reference for Earth Science instructors who wish to solidify and deepend their knowledge and understanding of invertebrates",positive

If your intrest lies in the substance of this book, read some other review, I'm only going to tell you that, the (1909) publication, stinks; the so called book, is more like a oversized magizine, and the print is about the size of a footnote in the bible",positive

I found tons of new information on mushrooms in spite of the fact that I studied mushrooms in college (until my father decided science was not for girls and convinced me to go to Law School. Yep, those were the good old days.) You will enjoy it as long as you take into account that it is a scientific book, perfect for geeks",positive

"This is one of the finest popular histories I have ever read.  Whether it is a book about 5th and 6th century British history using Arthur as a organizing principle, or a book about the ""real"" Arthur using 5th and 6th century history as a backdrop, this book is wholly convincing concerning the reality of Arthur and the historical context in which he lived.  The book may actually be too good.  The most convincing evidence it cites -- the so-called British Easter Annals -- appear  to have been called into question by subsequent scholarship; and the link between Arthur and Mount Badon is not quite as convicing as it seeme to be when Alcock wrote the book.  In short, this masterpiece needs updating.  But a masterpiece it is.  No one who reads this book with any care can fail to come away from it without a vastly improved understanding not only of the British dark ages, but of the nature of historical evidence, scholarship, and truth.  This is a great book",positive

"This story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing. It clearly establishes a sense of time and place (modern day Madison, Wisconsin) and offers the ""promise"" of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) from the perspective of a personal caregiver. While we learn to understand the struggles of the patient, Kate, this is more about the struggles of a college student known as ""Bec,"" as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own. Author, Michelle Wildgen, fulfills the promise.",positive

"I recently re-read ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA prior to attending The Colorado Shakespeare Festival's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in Boulder. Drawn from Sir Thomas North's 1579 English version of Plutarch's Lives, William Shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career, around 1607, and published it in the First Folio in 1623. It tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers, Roman military leader, Marc Antony, and the captivating Queen of Egypt (and former mistress of Julius Caesar), Cleopatra. When his wife, Fulvia unexpectedly dies, Antony is summoned from Egypt to Rome to mend a political rift with Octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister, Octavia. Of course, this news enrages passionate Cleopatra. She vents her anger on the messenger, but is quick to realize that Octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty. However, Antony soon follows his heart back to Cleopatra's arms, abandoning his new wife in Athens. This leads to war, when Octavius declares war on Egypt. After Octavius eventually defeats Antony at Alexandria, Cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide, which prompts Antony to wound himself mortally. Antony dies in his lover's arms, and rather than submit to Roman rule under the new Caesar (Octavius), the heart-broken Cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs. In the end, ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes. It is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand Shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next.",positive
"I read The Hundred Penny Box when I was in third grade 13 years ago.  Its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever.  I have created my own Hundred Penny Box and just made one for a friend's newborn son.  My grandfather was recently diagnosed with altzheimers, an illness I assume that great-great-Aunt Dew suffered from.  I took my ratty old copy of the book to his house over Easter.  We read it together and discussed his own memories over the years.  While his memory is fading, I felt it important to hear them myself, love them, and save them in my own memory as Michael did for Aunt Dew.  I would reccomend this book to any child who is losing a grandparent and anyone who needs a good, heartwarming story",positive
" I liked the book but you also have to consider the end killer... Is that logical at all?? The senator is in his late fifties and so how old is his father? If he had the senator when he was twenty he'd have to be 77. Is it really reasonable that he's running around killing people, and setting houses on fire. It was a very unlikely twist to the end. It still was a good book",positive
"Carson McCullers, one of America's greatest Southern writers, was often misunderstood, as many people were put off by or unwilling to  deal with her (at the time) controversial subject matter.

"For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history.  It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations:  The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine;  the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers --  Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the ""spoiler"", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others.  This book is written in a traditional English historian's  prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period.  In spite of some reviewers' claims of a ""Protestant bias"" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of  the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia.",positive
"I just got through reading ""Harvey Penick's Little Red Book"".  I enjoyed it so much that I had to apologize about my delay in submitting a positive comment on the seller's feedback page. But the book was that enjoyable! I read the book because I was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals.  I don't even play golf! I was able to apply Harvey Penick's words to attitudes and approaches to life though!  He not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life, but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one's life.  His methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me.  He refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings.  Instead, he accentuates the positive.  He educates by guiding his students instead of ""teaching"" them.  I love his ability to teach with images, parables and metaphors.  His chapter ""First Things First"" about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great!  After all, the problem is not always what you think.  I challenge anyone to read ""Harvey Penick's Little Red Book"" and share with me how they can apply his knowledge to thier business and personal lives.  Whether you play golf or not, this book is good reading",positive
"Today, I heard Sister Prejean speak about her book Dead Man Walking and about all of the experiances that shes been through concerning the death penalty.  Nothing less than amazing.  Dead Man Walking calls upon the unjustices in the death penalty but also on the actual death penalty victims.  Many people think that death penalty victims are just plain bad people.  Read this book.  If you want to be challenged on your views, read this book.  You can't be idle on the death penalty.  Also, coming soon is the Death of Innocence.

It's easy to read, so one can browse through it  like a newspaper or magazine.....but it's also stuffed full of valuable  information about the technical aspects of skating and the &quot;behind the  scenes&quot; preparation activities for competitive skaters.

Many years ago I read &quot;In The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; and &quot;The Clowns of God.&quot; I enjoyed both of these books but not enought to search out and read the third book in the trilogy.  What a mistake! This book contains the politics of power, the behind the scenes strugles and the fears and doubts as well as the faith and triumphs of the servants of the Vatican, as well as the Italian and international scene.  The relationships both formed, forming and parting kept me glued to the book.  The pace was fast and enthralling.  Do not miss this book. The end was somewhat predictable, but never-the-less still shocking",positive
"The Man of Her Dreams The Woman of His! is a book that is critically necessary today in light of our divorce culture.  Sadly, it equally affects Christians the sames as non-Christians.  Joel pulls no punches in assigning the blame to men's arrogance and poor exploitive biblical exegesis.  The back and forth style communicates the same cooperation and give and take necessary for successful marriages.  This book is must read for the engaged, newlyweds, and those struggling to stay together.  All cliches aside, this is a must read.",positive

"First, the story takes place in the 1940s (Harold's brother is MIA in WWII, not in Vietnam, as the Amazon.com review erroneously states).  Second, the writing is superb.  Mr. Lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel.  His characters are very real.  His setting (a small, struggling circus, traveling the western U.S.) is historically believable, peopled with 'freaks' who  suffer as sideshows, unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with, but peopled also with 'normals' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks.  Harold, the 14-year-old albino central character, tries to straddle both groups of people.  He finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer.  I am admittedly ignorant about such things, but Mr. Lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants--crucial to the plot of the novel--seem believable.  My only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end.  I do want you to read this book, so I will try not to give anything away here, but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character's last words and even Gomer Pyle-like (People actuallly say ""Gosh!"").  This did detract from the impact of the death, unfortunately, but I still very strongly recommend this book.  Five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot!         ",positive

"I read a review of this in L.A. Weekly which said that it was &quot;a lot  of fun&quot; and entertaining in a sort of ironic way, despite the fact  that it became more slapstick at the end.  I read it, and agreed for the  most part, except I felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier  than I had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than I  would have thought from the initial satirical tone.  The ending was a  little over the top, but it was an example of the kind of senseless  fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives.  All  in all, I thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel",positive
"The language, the words, the concepts, the illustrations, the points he brings out, everything in this book is beautiful. The metaphors he will use to get a certain point across, is brilliant, simple, creative, nimble; he dances around philosophical discussion with grace.

"Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, ""A Clockwork Orange"" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.",positive
"Renowned artist and tarot scholar/writer Robert M. Place has produced a masterpiece in his new tarot 384 page companion book, The Buddha Tarot Companion: A Mandala of Cards.

Other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the Buddha cards include: ""Smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading."" and ""Store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy, promote healing, or provide protective energy."" Also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards. Both items are published by Llewellyn, who as always, have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented.",positive
"House Poor identifies the key issues consumers need to know to survive the current volatile housing market.  The style is brisk and understandable, and the information is focused and useful.

When activity in many housing markets begins to decline from its current unsustainable level, many people will wish they had read the advice in Fletcher's book. ",positive
"Though I usually go in for tough police thrillers, I sometimes mix things up by reading a light, funny mystery or- like this book- a quiet, thoughtful mystery set in a small town (a ""cozy"", I believe this type of mystery novel is called).  ""Still Life"" nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a ""cozy"" mystery- quirky, eccentric characters, a small-town setting, pretty much no violence- with a little modernity, in the form of occasional well-placed profanity (though not much) and modern demographics (a gay couple is included among the main characters).",positive
"One reviewer claims that this is marred by some of Eliot's unfurtunate preducices. But how come you don't say something like that about O' Henry. We can't just stop reading authers because you we don't like their views. Someone calls hemingway looking forward? If that's looking forward I'de rather look backward. Hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever. Most of the people that reviewer named justly loved Eliot. Eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past, but towards what we have made out of the present. In name of progress, we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. To call Eliot Conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous, the first draft according to one of Eliot's biographers, was absolutly a expression of Relavtism. One critic accused him being a Nihilist. ",positive

"Generally, my eyes glaze over as I reach chapter 3 of most business books as they provide the mastery of the intuitively obvious. Make Your Own Luck by Shapiro and Stevenson has broken the pattern. Written in punchy conversational style, the book is a delightful combination of anecdotes and useful tools geared to help the reader up the odds in personal and business decision-making. The process of setting goals and assessing risk is broken down into discrete aspects, allowing the reader to assess his own patterns of success and failure. This sounds as if it could be tedious, but it's not. The authors know you are not sitting in a policy course. They know that you make numerous bets in any given day and do it most of the time without focusing on the decision as a bet. The book makes you conscious of those bets and gives you the groundwork to move through those bets with speed and focus. In managing investments, I'm betting on a gestalt of macro economic factors and company specific performance as well as betting on the actions of other investors. The tools in Make Your Own Luck, such as the Prediction Map, are completely applicable to the inferential analysis I use in managing investments as well as life's major problems, such as how to seat guests at the next dinner party. This book is a good read. Shapiro and Stevenson incorporate topics from baseball to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Make Your Own Luck makes you laugh, makes your think and gives you tools to improve your own lot. ",positive

"IRONWEED by William J. Kennedy was the latest selection for a book club I've recently joined.  The premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel.  As I expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the screenplay being written by Kennedy himself.  Jack Nicholson plays the main character (Francis) and Meryl Streep is his ""wanna be"" socialite girlfriend (Helen), but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what Kennedy had already done in the novel.",positive

"Luc Ferry raises some very important and pressing questions about the implied praxis behind deep ecology.  Does the vision of society espoused by deep ecology depend on an authoritarian social structure?  Does deep ecology demand a level of political correctness which places its premises beyond question?   Ferry is not the first to raise these questions.  The Institute for Social Ecology, led by Murray Bookchin, has made the critique of deep ecology its bread and butter.    Of course, there are plenty of ideologues within radical ecology, but they do not make up the whole story.  Particularly glaring is Ferry's one-sided depiction of eco-feminism.  In fact, some eco-feminist work in the U.S. has been particularly sharp at questioning the orthodoxies of both radical ecology and feminism. The questions which occupy Ferry should be asked by every person who is involved in radical ecology, and many of his criticisms are on-target for a specific body of work.  But he doesn't bother to see the whole picture, and readers should be careful to read beyond the quotes cited by Ferry and to study deep ecology and ecofeminism on their own terms",positive

I was very excited to get my hands on this book.  I have been ordering this series from Amazon.co as they are released as I can get them several months ahead on their American counter parts.  I must say that I was disappointed with the beginning of the book.  First- Hem is not the character that I wanted to read about.  Second- the start is slow and the plot drags a little.  But- all is forgiven after 100 pages.  I warmed up to Hem.  I actually think that the authors writting style has improved each book and this book just feels right.  I was done reading way before I wanted to be done.  The ending is nothing but action.  I put the book down entertained and wanting more.  What else can you ask for in a work of fictio,positive
"As I began to read this book, I was reminded of Jack Dempsey's observation that ""champions get up when they can't."" All of us have encountered professional setbacks of one kind or another and some of them are especially difficult to overcome. Most of the examples which Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Andrew Ward cite in this book involve CEOs who either ""fired back""and eventually prevailed after a career setback (e.g. Donald Trump, Martha Stewart, Bernie Marcus, Jimmy Carter, and George Foreman) or never fully recovered from them (e.g. Jill Barad, John Scully, Leona Helmsley, Jacques Nasser, and Linda Warnaco). The former demonstrate the importance of ""seven lessons to turn tragedy into triumph"" which Sonnenfeld and Ward recommend; the latter demonstrate the probable consequences of failing to understand and then apply those lessons on which a five-step strategy - ""for rescuing and restoring a career and reputation after a devastating professional setback"" -- is based.

"I read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me, that's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again. Oh Boy am i glad i bought it! Since last time i read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong. This book still made my heart race, made me smile at Joe's attempts to make Ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them. ",positive
"Whether everything's on the level here or not I have no idea but in the neverland of Hollywood it doesn't surprise me that an ex-Mouseketeer could be drawn into the shadowy and dangerous circle of colorful mobster Mickey Cohen.

"I give this book a 4 star rating, not because I believe in ""The Necronomicon"", but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the 1970s. The Simon Necronomicon itself is an interesting tome (though I doubt it's ""authenticity"" per se). It is at least as valid a grimoire as any other, and more valid than some. ""Dead Names"" has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique ""wandering bishop"" phenomena and the so-called Slavonic Orthodox Church. Overall, both an informative and entertaining volume, whether you ""believe"" or not",positive
"Mr. Fleishman has written and clear and concise primer on Home Theater.  Clearly, from his years as a staff writer for Audio Video Interiors and other pubs, he has an in-depth knowledge of the ins and out of HT.

"Piglia muestra que es un explorador de nuevas formas narrativas, pero la lectura de este libro y de otros suyos nos deja ver a un autor que no se deja leer con facilidad, que es críptico; debe ser leido con mucha atención, con papel y lapiz en la mano para seguir sus tramas y personajes y eso no  es un virtud en un escritor",positive
"Caine's book is by far the most practical book on acting I've read, and I've read a few.  Some are very beautifuly written, poetic and psychological, but for someone who really wants to learn something about acting for film, I would recommend this book first.  It is at times bleakly honest but highly readable.  If you've done any acting, you'll find yourself nodding frequently",positive
"This is the second book in the Wind Dancer series. The Wind Dancer being the first, which was excellent.  I almost feel as if I liked Storm Winds even more than The Wind Dancer, and I believe it's due to a more comprehensive, abundance of history.  I was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book from the first chapter until the last one.  The characters were very individualistic and intriguing.  I have to say I enjoyed the romance more between the two supporting characters:  Catherine and Francois, more than the main characters:  Juliette and Jean Marc.  I was enamored by Francois and his strength, steeliness, and sensuality.  Jean Marc was a dark, handsome man as well.  Because of the way Juliette was treated in her youth, I see why she was so desperate for someone to need her; hence her demanding, take-charge attitude to care for her friend and others.  Catherine was a delight.  She was soft, caring, and sweet, but her terrible experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature.  Fascinating characters and historical background.  I would recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn't the typical,dull Harlequin type and a love for important historical eras.",positive
"Based on the description, I expected this to be a DaVinci Code knock-off, but gave it a shot since I recieved a free copy.  Comparing Labyrinth to The Davinci Code do it injustice; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it's own right.  I enjoyed the characters, plot, and switching between the past and present.  I'm not sure it has literary value (I wouldn't argue that The DaVinci Code does, either), but it's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow",positive
"My son loves to read, and he adores this book.  I personally love Trapani's books--while they are not always grammatically correct (the only reason why I don't give it a 5 star rating), they are beautifully  illustrated and bring to life some of the most well-known nursery rhymes.   It will bring a smile to your child's face",positive
"I have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost 5 years now.  Last year I had over 1400 seedlings on multi-level shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room. (Boy do I need a greenhouse!)  So this book was not a lot of new information to me.  A lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet, but it's not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before I buy it.  (This is important, because I'm not interested in refrigerating my seeds 3 weeks before I plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds.) One major thing missing from this book was photography.  There were drawings, but I'm sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool.  On the good side, this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment, and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant (annual, perennial, etc), its hardiness zone, and its flowering season.  This allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone.  The regular index wasn't very useful, but one wonderful addition was an index of the common &amp; latin names.  I refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography I was missing.  (Almost makes up for it....almost!) Of course, there is the standard hardiness zone map, but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates.  (Nice!)  Also included was a directory of seed companies and their addresses.  All in all, this book does a good job of covering the seed part, but a poor job of covering the bloom part",positive

"As a Social Worker in private psychotherapy practice, I find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at times I question whether I should make more of an effort to consider the latest trends in psychotherapy. Mary Pipher affirms that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as compassion, empathy, listening skills, reframing and the ability to induce a sense of calm are timeless. Furthermore, even if I wasn't a therapist I think I would still devour this book because her writing is a pleasure to read. I highly recommend it for anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have been in the field for decades. This book is bound to become a classic",positive

"Alien invasion stories have been done to death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. This makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting. ",positive

He promptly left college and attached himself to a shady, Indiana-Jones-style South American graverobber. The graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth, then only a few years old.  Moseley was sent crisscrossing the US to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period 1947 - 1954.  The book never materialized, but Moseley was left with extensive notes, and the indelible and accurate impression that, apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they didn't recognize, and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar, the majority of the mythmakers were, as my old Grandma used to say, ""crazy as a betsy-bug.""",positive

The premise of this series, a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases, is original and fun to read. Abby is a psychic, but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money, sibling and romance issues. In this latest book, Abby, her sister Cat, and Abby's handyman Dave, buy and plan to renovate a house, only the house turns out to be haunted! Poor Dave, Abbey's partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation! Determined to find out what's going on, Abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to WWII Nazi Germany. In order to solve the mystery, Abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case. There is danger for Abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between Abby and Dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple. Ms. Laurie has a great series going here, and I look forward to reading more Abby mysteries.",positive

"Love Letters has a very simple concept: Two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage. They never look at each other. But within these letters is so much humor, love, and truth that the  play will carry you away with delight.  I read this play as I was browsing  through a bookstore. I just wanted to read the first couple of pages since  I'd heard so much about it. After page three, I didn't want to put it down.  Now I'm  buying it for a friend.  Don't think this play is a sappy  collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder. If you have  ever been in love, you WILL recognize parts of yourself in this. It always  stays true to its well-drawn characters, which is what makes the end so  heartbreakingly wonderful",positive
"This book has a lot of information about how protecting wild areas works in WA and and an overview of the protections offered by the United States Government. It then provides the inspiration to get people started through true stories of grassroots projects. While the book doesn't list 1, 2, 3, what needs to be done to start a grassroots movement, that shouldn't be expected, because all people have different motivations, and this book should be used as a tool to help you understand the basics of how these sorts of movements work. A must for anyone who wants to further understand Washington state for all of its great wild places, or anyone for that matter, that is looking for inspiration on why wild areas should be protected.

"Bailie draws on Rene Girard's theory of foundational violence as the generative cultural force, and explores its modern effects on a culture no longer enthralled by ritual or sacralized violence.  I found especially compelling the newspaper accounts of violent acts which have taken place within my own memory.  Bailie uses these along with historical accounts of scapegoating to illustrate his theory, producing a hard-hitting indictment of all forms of violence, whether isolated actions or legalized responses to a violent act.  Increasingly, I find it difficult to distinguish between an act of violence and an act of retributive justice.  I have not read a newspaper account of a violent encounter the same way since reading Violence Unveiled, nor do I react to photojournalism with my previous detachment.  The impact stays with me, despite the fact that I read the work initially two years ago when I borrowed it from a friend.  I now have my own copy, heavily underlined and notated in the margins with thoughts spawned by Bailie's excellent analyses.  Provocative and insightful",positive

He alternately found himself loving the narrator, Yuriko's sister, for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of Kazue. Meanwhile, I found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of Kazue's meritocratic dreams, but a moment later I wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator. Perhaps it reminded me too much of what I had seen growing up to shock me.",positive

"Yes, Ben Witherington is a (relative) conservative, but don't hold that against him. Yes, he has strong opinions, but don't hold that against him, either, because they are well argued. The fact remains that this is the best overview of &quot;Third Quest&quot; Jesus scholarship I have been able to find. Admirers of the Jesus Seminar may not appreciate his critique, but it is very fair and well-thought out. One of the benefits from a book like this, besides giving interested parties a launching pad for further research, is that the different views of Jesus can help one achieve a well-rounded portrait of the Savior. No one scholar gets it right all the time (not even Witherington, with his own view of Jesus as God's wisdom), but the different insights are valuable, because Jesus is bigger than what any one person can comprehend. That should be a cause for humility (something some Jesus scholars have lacked, at least in print). I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in contemporary Jesus scholarship",positive

"I first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages.  The children were enthralled with the illustrations (as were many adults) but the &quot;message&quot; was deeply felt by the &quot;older&quot; child in all of us there.  It is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have.  Mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him, and brought him pleasure.  He wished that he could influence others, but never knew what his music did for the world.  Maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for.  The message is true for children and adults alike. I will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend, and from the pulpit. Thank you, David McPhail",positive

In our hurry to accumulate material goods, we must be careful to not take advantage of the artisans and producers of these third-world nations.  Fair trade is a concept whose time has come",positive

"Charles H. Kahn's account of the Pythagorean philosophical tradtion, although less than 200 pages long, is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. In a concise, but intelligent, summary, Kahn traces Pythagoreanism from its semi-legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as Copernicus and Kepler. As a young academic who specialises in the Pythagorean tradition I can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars, but as a Latinist I must say I was disapointed by Kahn's treatment (or lack of) of this strand of Western philosophy in late Roman and Medieval thought. But, this is still the best up to date history of Pythagoreanism available in the English language",positive

"This book written by Don Brown is a wonderful children's book.  In this story, set in 1870, Mary Kingsley uses her childhood to motivate her travels to Africa. Mary begins the story as a child, who is taking care of her ill mother. Her father travels a lot, and is rarely home. Although Mary never attended school she loves to read and uses this to escape. Mary, now an adult travels to Africa which was a big accomplishment for a woman at that time. The book tells some of her experiences in Africa. Without revealing what happens at the end, I will tell you that Mary has many experiences in this children's book. She takes the reader through her life.

"Generations of hate come together in this book.  Pete Braga killed Franklin McMichael dead in a claim of self-defense in the summer of 1952.  The next generation carried on the tradition when Gabriel McMichael supposedly beat Pete's son, Victor, so severely that he suffered permanent brain damage, rendering him with the IQ of a ten-year old.  The third generation was naïve to all this hatred when Thomas McMichael fell in love with Pete's granddaughter Patricia.  The love of his life was driven away at a young age when Grandfather Pete refused to permit their love to blossom.  While the McMichael family existed in near poverety, the Braga family thrived in power and money.",positive
"Going to Barsetshire is a delightful book, and a much-needed accompaniment to the Thirkell novels.  Ms. Snowden obviously spent a great deal of time reading the 29 novels in Thirkell's Barsetshire series, and has produced a companion to the series that makes it very easy to keep track of the characters, places, and cultural references, especially for an American who is not well versed in mid-20th Century English esoterica.  I also enjoyed the writing style and the well-chosen quotes.       In addition to the book's comprehensive content is its straightforward layout and user-friendly format. This exemplary reference guide is not a flashy publishing house production, but instead keeps with the simple charm of Barsetshire in its quality and overall appearance. The original cover art, showing an idyllic Barsetshire scene, is lovely.       I heartily recomend the book to all Thirkell fans",positive
"We are in the last part of the 19th Century in this novel, and the Wild West has breathed its last. The book is peopled with real legends (Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, Sitting Bull) and fictional curiosities (Jim Ragg and Bartle Bone - two Mountain Men, and No Ears - an Indian with exceptional eyesight). McMurtry relates a sad, elegiac farewell to times past. The ever-interesting characters and their views of the world, which are wise and funny and fascinating, make the novel top-notch in the McMurtry canon",positive

"Did we need a Gore Vidal reader? The author is something of a long-winded blowhard, commenting at length (and I mean LENGTH) on every topic imaginable. In that respect he is America's Voltaire, creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics, the arts, and religion and morals. It's hard to say where Vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism, as he is not a conventional leftist. Because of his iconoclasm, this collection can only inform the reader about Gore Vidal, not his times nor any intellectual or political movement. All that said, Vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit. This book is much too much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter collections instead -- but for a Vidal fan (or, say, a reader of &quot;The Nation&quot;) this book is worth the time commitment",positive
"Roger Caras, a very talented writer and animal lover, takes us on a tour of Thistle Hill, his farm in Northern Maryland.  Anyone who loves cats, dogs and other animals will love this book.

"While I consider myself a regular theatre-goer, I've always been aware of Kramer's plays and opinions, yet I haven't seen nor read either of these two plays. That changed this past weekend when I saw the revival of Normal Heart currently playing off-Broadway. This is a viscerally emotional piece of theatre and it makes one feel impassioned about what was going on in the world then and sheds a new light as to what's going on now in regards to the HIV/AIDS crisis. It's a must red if you don't have a chance to see it",positive
"This book is a really excellent source for anyone wanting to understand the reasons that Saudi Arabia is the way it is today. I was lucky to find my copy in a used bookstore. It does get a little tedious when discussing the business/oil aspects of the 1960's and 70's, but it's well worth it. It's a detailed history from start until publishing and that is definitely a relevant time.",positive
Lately there has been a lot of talk about how great Ronald Reagan was as a president. This book shows that this is not even close to being true. Under his presidency we went from the number one loaner to the number one debtor in the world. Him and his administration sold missles to Iran inexchange for hostages and then illegally took that money to support Contras in Latin America. Under his administrations hands off approach wall street ran wild with illegal and immoral practices. All this happened while his administration held down the poor and middle-class while giving the rich more money. It is debated whether Reagan knew some of these things were happening hence the title of the book. It is a very good read and easy to fly through the whole book. The only complaint about it is the lack of an indept description of the savings and loan scandle and the dredded star wars program. Recommended for anyone intrested in learning what happened behind the scenes of this presidency,positive

"This is a highly informative and accurate book.  It presents the data in a clear and graphic form, with a minimum of statistical manipulation.  The studies cited by the previous reviewer, Lloyd Rowsey, are based on econometric modeling.  Since the one he mentions, two other econometric models of abortion and homicide have been published with opposite results.  One is by Ted Joyce, the other by John Lott and John Whitney.  Econometric modeling can prove anything.  If you want to understand crime in America in the 1990s, buy The Crime Drop",positive
"Abel's Island is about a mouse named Abel.  He encounters a hurricane that separates him from his wife.  After the storm, he ends up on an island where he cannot escape because of the current surrounding the island.  He tries many ways to return to the place he loves, but all fail.  About a year after countless attempts to leave the island, a frog appears by accident. Gover, the frog, becomes friends with Abel and says he will come back with people to help Abel.  Abel's plans to return were very interesting.  His methods were very creative so it held my attention.  My favorite part was when he was fighting the owl.  I found a similarity between Abel and Stuart Little. Both had to navigate water. Stuart little was successful, but was Abel?  Read the book to find out.  ",positive
"QBQ! by John Miller is simply amazing. This little book is a grand slam all the way! QBQ strips away all the excuses and reminds us again where it is the buck is supposed to stop. If you're looking for an instruction manaual for leaders, here it is. People don't need tricks, methods, myths or secrets...what they really need is a tool that helps them step up to the plate and be accountable for their own results. One of the biggest weaknesses of the American workforce is the ability to accept responsibility and accountability for our own actions.   Bravo for QBQ",positive

"I've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions, Jack Kornfield's book, A Path with Heart, answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one's own time.  His  voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and  wise.  He starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes  on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by  bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face.   What I love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle,  practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to  explore, commit to, love being on the path.  If my house were on fire and I  had to grab only one book on my way out the door, it would be A Path with  Heart",positive
"This is a great book.  I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen  next and how all the mixups would be straightened out! It is a very funny  and delightful book, I hope there will be a sequel, we need to know what  happens to these people, I feel like I know them",positive
"The Climb was written by Bourkeev and DeWalt as an answer to Krakaur's ""Into Thin Air"". While not showcasing the same prose as Krakaur's book, I feel that this is utlamitely better. My reasoning for this opinion is that ""The Climb"" seems like a much more fair and unbiased account. Bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game; he simply tells the story as he experienced it. Krakaur, it seemed to me at least, relied to heavily on assumptions, and we all now what happens when you assume (hint: you make an _____ out of you and me) and came off as very arrogant and (for some reason) took a feverious dislike to Bourkeev and Lopsang. Thought not as well written as ""Into Thin Air"", ""The Climb"" still managed to draw me in fully, although some parts of the book are a little confusing, mainly the interview with Bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed. This interview was conducted in English, the only problem with that is that Bourkeev's English is not very strong! It is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper. DeWalt tries to help by adding ""translations"" about what Bourkeev is saying but I felt the interview should have been caried out in Bourkeev's native tongue of Russian and then translated into English. To not have done this is a great injustice to Bourkeev. If you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the May 1996 Everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money (as Krakaur's clearly was), read this. I really recommend you read both books, though and also check out the IMAX movie ""Everest"".",positive

To really grasp the experience, the author has certainly covered her basis in terms of depth, substance, truth and validity.  ",positive
"This book is a very good resource for parents of underachievers, former underachievers, and anyone who wants to understand the success of their child. Having read other reviews by readers discounting this book and discounting human psychology itself, I was compelled to write my own review. No one blames parents, especially Dr. Rathvon they do the best they can with what they've got; mental resources specifically. This book is for anyone who knows that their child is capable of so much more. It is never too late to fix, polish, and fine tune a learning mind. Every student has the ability to achieve",positive

She read the book to parents, teachers, and students who attended the conference.  I was amazed on the writing, culture, and illustrations that she used for this book.  The novel serves as a tale of her childhood spending time with her family at her grandmother's house.  Overall, the story teaches children the value of traditions, family, and heritage.  In short, ""Mice and Beans"" is a good book to read",positive
"Moral Consciousness and Communicative Action is the primary anglophone source for Habermas's writings on &quot;Discourse Ethics.&quot;  Written in the early eighties, this translation, which was published in 1990, provides  a developmental perspective.  The focus of the essays moves from Habermas's  statements about the role of philosophy today, in &quot;Philosophy as  Stand-in and Interpeter, to his writing on reconstructive social science in  general, to his program for a discourse ethics in particular.  The final  papers address criticisms of this program.  The volume suffers a bit from  the fact that Thomas McCarthy's introduction is keen to locate Habermas's  position vis a vis various contemporary moral-philosophical standpoints,  but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the  broader canvas of Habermas's overarching social-theoretic project",positive

And when I'm out and discover part of a skull from a mammal, bird, amphibian, or reptile, I'll be able to find what that is too.

James' view of life as expressed by her characters can be very pessimistic at times (a contrast to her autobiography).  In this one, there is still the feeling that the characters are going through the motions of living, never really feeling any joy--or often even happiness.

"I once read an article in Horn Book Magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of Hans Christian Andersen polluting the minds of our young people today.  The review mentioned that stories like, ""The Snow Queen"", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of ""The Snow Queen"" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life.",positive

"This book covers all the elements of Game Theory, emphasizing intuition over mathematical formalism.  The philosophical aspects are also given a thorough  treatment.    The 8 appendices provide a more formal exposition  of several key concepts such as the Minmax Theorem, the geometry of  equilibria and Linear programming.  The book has not changed much since its  publication in 1957, but it is by no means  archaic.      Even for those  who have a modern and more rigorous textbook,  &quot;Games and  Decisions&quot; is  Highly recommended  as a supplement. There is something  for everyone in it",positive

My hat's off to Joe Weber.  Keep up the great work",positive
"This is by far my favorite novel by Forster, and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels, period. In his first book, Forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which I, at least, feel that he lost as he  got more self-consciously &quot;philosophical&quot; in later books like  Howard's End and A Passage to India. He makes wonderful use of the Italian  settings and of Italian art, bringing them to vivid life, undermining  tourist cliches, and weaving them gracefully into his main themes.  No  other book I know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly",positive

Knowing a bit of German, I can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for Gestalten.  the real value of the work beyond the translation, however, especially for first time readers, is found in the notes made by David Luke.  These notes are helpful for the historical context, allusions to Goethe's personal life and work, and allusions to philosophy, literature, and more ... all essential to understanding the work",positive

"Typee is based on Melville's experiences when, as a young man of 22, he ""jumped ship"" from an American whaling vessel on the island of Nukuheva in the Marquesas Islands of the South Pacific.  It is written in a straightforward narrative manner, but it is a work of fiction, NOT a journalistic report, something that is often overlooked.  While, like ""Moby Dick"", it contains lots of factual details, mostly quite accurate as confirmed by subsequent research, it is a much more complex tale than it appears to be on the surface.",positive
"I first purchased this book when I was a freshman in college seven years ago. It is without a doubt the best and easiest reference guide to writing I have ever read.  I love the plastic tabs that mark each section.  This guide is easy to read and follow it is organized in basic steps that are categorized accourding to section.  So for example if you need to find out how to cite a web page or a video tape, etc using the MLA style you just flip to the section called doucmentation clearly marked with a plastic tab.  I have since purchased an updated guide for myself and also bought one for my brother - a freshman in college.  I really wish I had this book when I was in high school.  I highly recommend this book to any high school, college, graduate student or writer.  I especially recomend this book for students with learning disabilities, I myself have ADD and before I got this guide I could not understand how to write a paper in the MLA style or in any style other than a book report.  I promise this is the easiest reference guide to writing ever published",positive

The grounding love is as much sexual as otherwise but that's understandable in view of the widely different backgrounds of Julie and Abu.  And it is not transient but deepens.

"This very fascinating book is a story written in the form of numerous letters and personal diary entries made by the principle character of the book.  It chronicals the life of a young Scottish woman forced to live first in China then Japan.  Well written and historically accurate, it's obvious the author is intimately familiar with the the culture, customs, history and life style of Japan.  This makes the book that much more interesting and fascinating for those who enjoy realism and demand accuracy in a story.  For all who've ever lived in Japan, it's a believable tale that literally makes you feel you've stepped back in a time machine to witness the birth of modern Japan.  For those who haven't lived in Japan, believe that the author has done his homework and is not simply just creating a fictional setting in his mind.  Because of this, he's able to focus on his character versus scene/setting development and thus creates a living breathing person in your mind.  The timespan covers over 40 years as the story weaves through her trials and tribulations, and shows how her fortitude and strength serve her through tumultuous events in her life.  A gripping tale that draws on your emotions and has you constantly rooting for her.  When the last page is read it leaves you wishing the story would continue, but even good books must end.  Be prepared to sit a spell.  Once you start reading you'll find it hard to put down",positive
"I bought this together with a ""best of"" CD, both containing a lot of songs I really wanted to play on the piano myself. That combination has allowed me to hear what Vince played while also reading through the music to see just what it is he played. Without exception, I've found the written music exactly true to what Vince recorded, including pick up notes, tricky min-maj-min progressions, arpeggios, diminished 9th chords, and what-not, and it has made some previously unapproachable passages much easier to understand. I've also been able to use the book as a sort of learning tool, getting a feel for what a jazz musician really tries to accomplish when he sits down and plays a piece. I would like to have seen some fingering indications included, and without those, I think some beginners will not be able to do much with this work. And personally, I didn't find the performance notations particularly useful (""laid back"" doesn't really convey much to me), but like I said, I also purchased a CD of Vince's music, so I already have an idea of what sort of sound I want to achieve. Other than those two minor points, I can't find anything wrong with this edition. The binding is ""lay flat"" perfect bound, so the pages stay glued together but pull away from the spine, allowing this book to retain a crisp appearance and feel even after the pages are pulled open on a music stand. Guaraldi fans and aspiring jazz pianists will gain a lot from this work",positive

"Anyone who reads this book would not be surprised at the runaway success of the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series, since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with Bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture. Indeed, the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the Reagan White House. And, Christian or not, who hasn't heard of the term &quot;Antichrist&quot; or the significance of the number &quot;666&quot;? This book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology, including the role of Israel, Russia, the Arab countries, Europe, and the United States. It also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years (Turkey was considered Gog and Magog before Russia was, and the Pope was designated as the Antichrist for years before Hitler and Henry Kissinger came along). The final chapter, written at the brink of the collapse of the Soviet Union, demonstrates how, once again, premillenial thought adjusts itself (or sometimes not) depending upon world conditions. This is a fair, even-handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon",positive

I would skip through parts like those describing how to build a bean cooker, because such descriptions were so detailed.  If you're a technical/hands-on person, then you probably would like knowing how items/tools were built from raw materials in the frontier. But for me, I was more interested in the story, than the instructionals.",positive

"This book contains the childhood memoirs of Peter Reich.  As the son of psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich, Peter led a bizarre life.  He lived with his parents on the family estate of Orgonon in the backwoods of Maine.  Not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy, but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy.  As Wilhelm's only child, Peter was one of the first recipients of Reich's therapy methods, which involved special forms of touch, energy channeling, ""softening the stomach"", and inducing vomiting (in Peter's account). Peter was also made lieutenant in his father's defensive squad that protected the earth from UFO attacks through the use of ""accumulator guns"".  The elder Reich eventually got in trouble with the FDA for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness.  The court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court.  Not long after being sent to prison, he passed away, apparently of heart failure.  Upon his father's death, Peter found himself at the tender age of 13 forced to confront his father's legacy of brilliance and madness.  Up until the time of his father's death, he had believed everything his father told him, not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father's version of reality was from most other people's, nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father's explanations and standard scientific approaches.  In this book, Peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not, what is his, and what is his father's.",positive
"This book is a must for anyone who works with older adults.  It is a photographic essay of some very special people....people who embrace the robustness of life, and who are disciplined to maintain their capabilities as long as possible.  Our world is steeped in ageism, that is, believing that older people are only capable of doing things that are &quot;appropriate&quot; for their age.  This book shatters those beliefs and provides living examples of people who continue doing what they love to do physically.  I wish that Etta Clark would revise this book with a new set of photos every year!  I have seen some of these photos over and over again in lectures that people give about aging.  It is a book to be owned, not borrowed",positive
"This book is a celebration of color and the watercolor medium.  Turning  the pages is like watching a fabulous fireworks display.  Each page reveals  another explosion of beautiful color painting.  Like fireworks, some  paintings go off with a huge bang, and others are more muted; but each  painting has something to say -- there are no &quot;duds.&quot;  Helpful  comments by the artists give insight as to how and why each painting was  done.  If you're an artist looking for inspiration, this book can really  give you a whack in the side of the head that will send you running to your  paints.  Even if you're not an artist, you'll enjoy the gorgeous colors and  wide, wild variety of subjects and techniques.  An astonishing book and  well worth the price",positive

"Angela Davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era. This autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood. Her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison. One factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a 5-star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman. She focuses entirely on the black power movement. In closing, this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves",positive

Really folks if some of us turned off our TVs and used that time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great possibility for personal sexual freedom.

This book is a real insight into the Christian faith  of how to be a true follower of Christ who cared so much about individuals, especially those who were not self righteous, but fallen and in need of grace to restore their lives.

"For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process.

"This classic chronicle of Presidential campaigns, from the get-go to contemporary times, has the unusual virtue of being useful either as a collection of short readable chapters - each just the right size for a daily bus or train ride - or as a reference source. Reading this in the wake of Monicagate and the Florida Recount, it's instructive to read the history of Grover Cleveland, who seems to have features of BOTH past Democratic candidates.

Like Gore, his career was rudely interrupted by an election which he won on popular votes but lost, in a hotly contested, knife-edge electoral college tally",positive

Events disrupt her life as the case develops and federal agents demand that she reveal the name of the source.

"More than anything else Alan Furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of World War II espionage. I.A. Serebin inhabits the urbane world of Russian emigres in the Europe of 1940-1941, mainly in Paris, but also in Roumania. Serebin is recruited into what seems to be the British secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of Roumanian oil to the Nazi war machine. The whole operation reeks of amateurism - appropriate enough at that stage of the war - brainy, careful, daring, but amateur. With one exception, none of the players know completely what they are part of - which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line. Still Furst's prose forms the characters into full-dimensional beings from Bogart's Casablanca or Graham Greene's Human Factor. ",positive

We're doing a research project on oceans, and while we have a few good resources, I felt this one, with its 3d imagery, would more likely capture and hold his attention. What I didn't realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine. For me, 3D had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches.

Instead, out of either laziness or taking the easy road, we fail because it is so easy to do so. Besides, the customer will always walk in the door. Right? As this book reminds us, the customer may never be back. It is in the insight of a professioanl like Tasca that we are reminded of wehat we may already know. Again, our implementation of these rules which he explains simply, we will achieve. Another book I encourage is ""Cars and People: How to Put the Two Together.""",positive

"Set in a German village reminiscent of Grimm's fairy tale world this book will quickly have readers under it's spell.  This tale within a tale within a tale concerns a young clockmaker,Karl, who needs to create a figure for the great clock of Glockenheim to mark the end of his apprenticeship.  Time is running out for Karl and he is fretful because has not yet made the figure. At this same time Fritz, a young storyteller is telling his latest spooky tale to the villagers.   Fritz launches in to a very mysterious tale of a prince, who it is disovered at his ""death"" is actually kept alive by clockworks rather than by a heart.  Also in Fritz's story is a stange man named Dr. Kalmanius.  When this highly unusual man is described by the storyteller an identical man suddenly appears. The stunned audience quickly leaves.  As the others leave this strange man  approaches Karl and presents him with the needed clock figure ""springing"" Fritz's tale alarmingly to life.  As always Philip Pullman creates a vibrant and engaging cast of characters who will leave an imprint on the reader's memory. The illustrations by Leonid Gore capture both the fairy tale spirit and the horror under the surface.  This is a quick but original and engaging read that will appeal to both horror and fairy tale fans.  Don't miss it",positive

"This book reveiw is on a book named Last Summer with Maizon.  This book is about two best friends named Margarate and Maizon who lives on Madison Street.  Her friend Maizon was accepted to Blue Hills, a school where really educated people go.  Margarate does not want them to be separated.  Every night she wishes Maizon will not get accepted.  But when Margarate's father has a second heart attack, he dies and now all Margarate has is Maizon, her mother, her little brother Jay and the people around.  Margarete was having a rough time anyway and then Maizon got accepted to Blue Hills.  When it was time for Maizon to leave Margarate, her mother and Maizon's grandmother dropped her off.  When Maizon wasn't there with Margarate her whole life changed.  At school she was becoming popular, she was liked now.  Days passed by and Maizon still didn't call.  When Margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house, that's when Maizon calls.  Margarate was so excited that Maizon wanted to come home.  Margarate ran to the grandmother's house telling her the news.  Margarate said Maizon wants to come home, the grandmother says that she would go get her.  When Maizon got home it was like old times, they ran into each others arms.  They then went to their favorite spot and started talking.  Maizon said she came back because she wasn't being treated right, she didn't feel the same. So they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend Maizon.  I think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars.  This book has mostly everything of real life.  It deals with best friends, for example like my friendship with Kiena.  It has separation, like my sister and me.  It has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson.  I think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life,it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life.  I like this book because it reminds me of my life, me and my friends, how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking.  It reminds me of how I lose people in my family and then cry because I miss them.  If I could buy this book, I would let my whole family read it, I would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do.  This book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it.  It is so good that I really read it because I don't really read books and when I read the book it made me think of when my best friend Ariel was going to move and how it made me feel, and how I compare it to Margarate and Maizon.  This book is excellent, the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend.  If you ask my best friend Johnniece, she'll say that she really enjoyed the book, that it should get five stars, because the author really put thought, confidence, respect, love, care and her whole heart into this book.  When I say she put confidence in this book I meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit.  The author thought about the words, thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion.  I think that this book should be the book of the month in my school, because it shows and teaches a lesson.  With the summary I wrote I put my heart in it because when I read it, it touched my heart.  I won't want my friend away from me.  I think that I mostly relate to Maizon, because when she left Margarte was beginning to be liked, and the girl was talking about Maizon and Margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend.  I relate to Maizon, I relate to her because if people don't like me, I don't care.  If people want me out of somewhere, then I'll leave and if people love me, I love them back and that's how Maizon is.  She doesn't take junk.  Alot of people relate to Maizon.  This book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on.  This book is really a good book that shows you friendship, break-up and everything else that deals with real life.  I love this book, it is really good and I think that if most people had this book then they wouldn't be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing.  This book really didn't grasp Dr. Kings dream because when Maizon went to Blue Hills, the whites were treating her bad, they saw her different.  Brenliniqua, Class 7-512",positive
"The Snow Goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read.  Set on the coast of England at the time of Dunkirk, it is less about the strife of WWII itself than about its three main characters - one of whom is the snow goose - and what binds them.  It is a story about nature, love, and nobility of spirit.  To say more would be to give too much away.  But it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades, and I reread it when I need to be reminded what is important in life",positive

"I am a huge Thomas Hardy fan, and I was not disappointed with this book. At first all the technical astronomical information was slow, but the love story started and that was forgotten. My only complaint about Two on a Tower is the ending. It seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages. It wasn't realistic for Viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later, considering she was only 33 at the end of the story. Sir Constantine was possessive, jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him. The bishop was full of himself - how is that worse? A few years with him and all of a sudden she's an old woman with a heart condition? Swithin comes back and says he'll marry her, she's overcome with joy and BOOM! She dies in his arms. I also find it strange that neither Swithin or Viviette acknowledged that the boy was his. Didn't people in the village realize who he looked like, since people were already suspicious of the lovers? What will happen next, Swithin takes his son in and marries Tabitha Lark? A very good, sad, complicated romance",positive

The second on developing God-honouring  relationships, dwelling mainly on the subject of communication. I was very  much enlightened by the types of circuit jammers within the family.

"Black Metropolis is perhaps the founding document of African-American studies, a classic work of sociology that still resonates today. It is a paradigmatic expression of the Chicago School of sociology, however, a  school that today stands in some disrepute, at least in some circles.  Indirectly, it was the target of James Baldwin's famous attack on Richard  Wright in his essay, Everybody's Protest Novel. The claim of the criticism  has been that the Chicago School, due to its insistance upon using a  &quot;scientific approach&quot;, merely reproduces the very terms under  which African-Americans have been oppressed--a claim that has proceeded  under the warrant of European intellectuals such as Theodor Adorno. Still,  Black Metropolis is a landmark study, and, unfortunately, many if not most  of its observations and conclusions remain true today, and in fact it could  be argued that conditions in the Black Belt of Chicago have gotten worse,  not better, since 1945, the year of Black Metropolis' publication--which  lends a certain credence to the criticisms mentioned above, though perhaps  it should be qualified by saying that they are not so much criticisms of  the Chicago School as they are criticisms of American society. Since then,  as we know, we have witnessed a great shift in American public opinion away  from what some consider to be the excesses of those days; so much so, in  fact, that the work of Black Metropolis may again be regarded as a  profoundly useful book. Embodying American liberalism as it does--which  counted as a grave sin thirty years ago--Black Metropolis may possibly be  due for a fresh look",positive

"If you like fantasy and are not acquainted with the works of Andre Norton, then this is an excellent starting point.  Believable, heroic characters and a well thought-out &quot;Witch World&quot; combine to make for an enjoyable read.  Simon Tregarth is transported through a mysterious gate into a world populated by people and other things not people.  A struggle goes on between good and evil, and it's not clear who is winning.  (But, we know who wins in the end - &quot;good&quot;, of course.)  The style of writing - more of a story that unfolds as it is read - is one strength that characterizes her writings.  That, and the fascinating settings, imaginative perils faced, and strong likable characters make this a &quot;must read&quot;.  This is a refreshing hard-to-put-down story.  It does not suffer from the typical overinflated, overwordy, overcomplicated, and overcharacterized (and lifeless) features of the usual fantasy megathon offered today",positive
"We have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science, math, and technological education for everyone. The first one occurred after the Sputnik fiasco, when the Russians beat us in the race to reach space. The  concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, and educators saw in comparison  of assessments made of students in the U.S. and those in other developed  countries, such as Japan. The answer to this concern was for the AAAS along  with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific  literacy, and what the public in the U.S. should at least know to be  scientifically literate. As usual, though the AAAS addressed the fact that  certain groups in the U.S. were not being 'included' in the pursuit of  science literacy, such as women and racial minorities, in this their first  book they skipped over those of us with disabilities. Since this is a major  concern of mine and the area in which I do research, I was appalled to see  they neglected 'us' once again, especially as the AAAS has a separate  department dealing with the Disabled/Deaf.  In spite of this mistake, the  writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges  as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that  our country can be more scientifically literate. With new information being  made available through newspapers and the Internet on a daily basis, it is  absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race, gender, or  ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of  information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care,  decisions on employment (since health care is one of the top employers in  the U.S. today), and to teach their children. This book was the beginning,  but it isn't the end. More books have further elucidated what is required  for science literacy from both the AAAS and other science groups. This is  the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their  students to become scientifically literate.

"Tony Kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of  &quot;the best&quot; pilots around. His use of case studies of real pilots  and real situations includes examples from the military, commercial, and  geneal aviation communities. In short, the book is useful for any pilot  whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed  as a senior airline captain. For many pilots, it will reinforce what they  already know and practice but for many, it will provide the opportunity to  become &quot;old&quot; pilots.  If you fly, read the book",positive
"I found this book to be helpful as an overall general guide. It covers much of the general information needed to start and keep a saltwater tank.

"    The story, Walk Across the Sea, by Susan Fletcher, takes place at a town near the ocean. White people thought themselves superior to others, especially the Chinese. Chinese were often looked down upon and shunned, mainly because of their religious beliefs. The lighthouse keeper's daughter, however, was different from other white people. Believing her father's talks about Chinese people in the beginning of the story, the girl, Eliza Jane, meets a Chinese boy around her age. After the Chinese boy saves her goat, Eliza becomes interested in the boy's behavior. Soon, she learns that everyone may not be as they seemed.",positive

In Just Generosity, Sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in America. And it is a compelling vision.",positive
"Richard Fortney's ""Earth"" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and how it relates to humankind.  Fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.

There is still a large ""assassination industry,"" which can afford to find documents that you haven't read and charge you with ignorance if you haven't read them, and find 15 more if you read them. This gives a common-sense overview that seems quite reasonable. I trust it.

"This book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era, that of border radio.  Brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of Texas/Mexico and beamed their signal into all of North America - one angry resident complained that was ALL he could get on his radio.  These stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an 'X'. This spawned an industry of singers, politicians, preachers and pitchman the type we now see on &quot;infomercials&quot;.  Mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you &quot;pulled&quot; in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - &quot;keep those cards and letters coming!&quot;  New Federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from Wolfman Jack to the Rev.

"Lovers of Mr. Rochester beware - in this, his second book of literary puzzles, John Sutherland turns his considerable powers of literary analysis towards, amongst other things, undoing the good reputation enjoyed by Jane Eyres brooding hero. Bronte fans, brace yourself for some idol-smashing. As in his first book of devoted to literary head-scratchers (the wonderful Is Heathcliff a Murderer?), Sutherland here sets himself out to answer some of Western literatures most intriguing questions. Though you might not always agree with some of the conclusions Sutherland comes to (we have to have a talk, he and I, about Mr. Rochesters moral integrity) as a writer he is always witty, as a thinker always innovative, and as a guide through literatures most baffling conundrums, always genial. Buy this book and I promise not only will you learn something (and, if youre anything like me, get into some very heated debates with fellow literature lovers about Jane Eyres prospects for bliss, etc.) - but youll also have a heck of a lot of fun",positive
"Let's Learn Kanji is systematic, it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge (including stroke order and radicals) as well as providing space to practice AND regular worksheets/mini tests so you can monitor your progress! Often kanji books offer only examples and written explanations, or focus soley on repeated written practice. The addition of the mini tests for consolidating your learning makes this book a must have. I studied some kanji previously but found my self directed study slow. While I agree with the other reviewer that the pace seem stedious at first, I after a month I can claim some serious progress! My only concern with this text is that from time to time the mini tests do not have an answer key. All in all an excellent book for self study by motivated beginners",positive

"Once again Larry McMurtry delivers the goods in this tale of The Old West . We are introduced to Calamity Jane who spends a lot of time writing letters to her daughter by the light of a campfire. Calamity Jane joins a Western Touring Company and the sea voyage to America is particularly memorable. There is also another character worth mentioning, namely a Native American called No Ears who views the world in terms of deep philosophical thought. Towards the end of the book we see Calamity Jane lamenting her lost youth and sadly reflects on the Glory Days of the Old West that she was once a part of. Larry McMurtry has writen a fine novel with a real, believable female character which is something most writers in this genre are unable to accomplish.Another wondrous tale from a Master Of His Craft",positive
"I took a class on Sociology and Law in college and my professor kept on referring to this book.  I decided to see what he was talking about first hand and am glad I did!

"This is a very thorough, very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the United States, and while it may not be as easily readable as, say, David McCullough's &quot;Truman&quot;, it is certainly less dry and slow-going than most scholarly works. If you're looking for a full-life biography of Monroe, one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure's life, this is an excellent choice. If you're looking for light reading with a historical basis, this is definitely NOT what you're looking for",positive

"Roman, by Roman Polanski is a very good book.  It is very touching about his memories of his late wife, Sharon Tate and their short life together.  Roman lost his wife and unborn child in 1969 by the Manson Group.  He had a  very hard life in Poland during WWII.  He lost both his parents during that  time, but he grew up to be a world famous director.  The book tells about  his struggles during these times, and also during the period after the  deaths of his wife and child.  He tells about his Hollywood days of  directing, his famous friends, famous people and then what turned out to be  his downfall...with the teenaged girl acusing him of sexual contact and him  being arrested.  To avoid persecution, Roman left the United States and has  been in exile in France ever since, but still directs and has released more  movies.   But, the book is very well told, and gives a good insite on  Roman's life and his career",positive

I'll never look at a squirrel the same way again",positive
"Yay--this book was fun and extremely informative.  At first, the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny (to keep it humorous for me, I conjured up in my mind a tall, overgrown middle-aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair, hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of 64 crayons).  Anyway, I digress.  As a doctoral graduate student taking a Neuroscience course--this book really helped me nail down structures of *way* too many things.  But ultimately, it helped me make the grade.  If you get the book, make sure to color in it--it really does help (not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day).  Otherwise, what's the use of buying a book like this--it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don't color in it.",positive
"This book is lovely, the perfect ""medicine"" for our hectic lives in this constantly-changing world.  It has a lot of information packed in, yet is presented in a clear, straightforward manner.

Geared towards older children (my daughter LOVES them all), they don't insult the intelligence of the reader (I enjoyed them more than much of the ""grown-up"" fiction I read). The series is best when you read them in order, as you meet the characters again in future books. The books were such a hit, I actully purchased them in hardback (gasp!) so that the rest of my kids can read & re-read them as they get older. We're eagerly waiting for the 7th book (and the 8th...) to come out in print!",positive

It's a great addition to the workbook Flip Flop Spanish, and also just for fun.., my littlest, a one-year-old girl, even looks at the pages and will sit with the boys to watch them. They're sturdy pages, full of all KINDS of things. The kind of book you find something new each time you open it. It has little lists to find items as well.",positive

"The theory behind this important collection of essays is that &quot;the history of medieval power is to be sought in microcosms.&quot; These essays demonstrate quite effectively that it can be found there as well.  Each  essay focuses on a facet of the shifting power relationships in twelfth and  thirteenth century Europe.  At issue in each are the questions of what or  who held the power to command or punish, and how that power was obtained,  kept and manifested.  This is a truly enlightening book. Of particular  interest are the essays on holding power over the truth, as well as those  dealing the formation of the nobility into a self-consciously chivalric  warrior class.  However, all the essays are intelligent and useful  explorations into the very nature and meaning of power.  Ultimately, this  book must be considered essential for any serious student of history,  casual or academic",positive

"I am finding this book quite helpful to getting to know myself better and to have greater control over my emotional responses, or mood. The authors guide you through several approaches of specific steps you should take to get to know some of your core beliefs, which they say may be causing depression. You are free to choose the approach that works best for you, but you do need to try them all to see what works. It is quite time consuming. One of the approaches requires you to record your activities and asses your mood every hour. The instructions are clear and concice and examples provided are helpful, however it does take a true commitment. I suppose it may be fair to say that true change most often does take real work",positive

"The trilogy just stunned me and I worked at trying to understand its complexities. Then I read this book, and everything made sense. At first I declared that the trilogy was better than 'The Lord of the Rings' but could not explain why. This book nails it. It will be wonderful if you read the trilogy, read this book, and share everything with your children. Remember when 'expanding your consciousness' was all the rage? No? That's OK.  All these books do it with a basis in science. Buy the darn books. Buy them for your friends",positive
"I found this book to be very helpful. It doesn't just give you the steps to do little tasks like some of the other books I looked at; it explains the features and why you would use them, and shows you how to do things from start to finish.

"It is almost like dream comes true when I saw the revised, new second edition out at the bookstore.  The imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor, but has graciously added new/updated materials in synthesis.  You may see it as an equivalent to Jerry March's Advanced Organic Chemistry but a whole different approach.  The sections on oxidations, reductions, and organoboranes are excellent.  Since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field, not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry.  Use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like Nicholaou's Classics in Total Synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry",positive
"I was introduced to this book while staying with a friend, and I was hooked.  I went home and bought it so that I could finish it.  I didn't know much about Buddhism before I read this book.

You do not need to be a Buddhist to appreciate this book!  It's very inspirational.  Since this book, I have read several more books to learn about the teachings of Buddha",positive

"I read this book even before it was assigned to my undergrad psychology class -- and then I read it again, and enjoyed it both times. De Wall does protest too much -- he's clearly answering his critics throughout -- but I found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing. More importantly, De Wall's arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive (not that I needed much persuading), and his use of anecdotes keep the book entertaining. I'm looking at my pet pooches in a whole new way these days",positive

"Peter Allen takes three of the most compelling aspects of human history--sex, disease, and religion--and weaves them together in a fascinating exposition of how religious authorities in the West have viewed  disease since the late Middle Ages. His book discusses the histories of  lovesickness, leprosy, syphilis, plague, masturbation, and of course AIDS.  For each disease (and yes, masturbation was considered a serious disease  well into the 20th Century!), he discusses how sex, and the sins associated  with it, figured into the religious and popular views of illness. Allen's  book is meticulously researched (he read texts in the original French,  Latin, German, and Italian) and elegantly  written. It is a far easier read  than most academic works. Most importantly, it offers insight into how  religious and sexual  intolerance can hamper the fight against disease,  even in today's world",positive

"Pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics, providing examples of practical application of each. This helps the reader develop a critical mind, capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis. Pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws, such as cultural and ethical relativism. The reader will find that Pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular, but rather calls for reason and judgment, based on strong moral principles, in every situation. Some situtations call for a utilitarian approach, some for a virtue-ethical approach. Whatever approach he takes, however, will be based in thorough and sound reasoning. This book makes its readers want to be better people.",positive

"This was the first VI Warshawski book I ever read, and it did an excellent job of whetting my appetite for more.  I think Paretsky did an excellent job of drawing me into VI's world, which is rich with unique characters.  VI comes across as individualistic and principled, and I like how Paretsky resisted cliché temptation on several counts: the complex issue of chemical responsibility is not wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of the book, and there is no &quot;obligatory sex scene.&quot;  Not that sex scenes don't have their places, but I just hate it when I'm reading along and I can almost hear the agent say, &quot;Okay, author, you need to steam this up a bit right here if you want to sell this book.&quot;  In this story, VI is all business, which is a delightful change of pace",positive
"Leah Stewart is a talented writer. I read this book after finishing her most recent novel, The Myth of You and Me (which I highly recommend). This story is dark and chilling. Olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in Memphis on a hot summer. When the body of girl is found, the case becomes eerily personal for Olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl's story and life. The characters in this novel are deep and well developed, and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in Memphis is well rendered. I highly recommend this book",positive
"This is an excellent book.  Its academic / sociological approach may put off some lay readers, but that would be too bad.  The subject, and the message, are both very important.  In many ways, this book is similar to &quot;The Appearance of Impropriety:  How the Ethics Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business and Society,&quot; but although this book is somewhat less accessible to general readers it is certainly stronger from a social-science standpoint.  An excellent book, well worth reading for anyone interested in why repeated efforts to stamp out political corruption have borne such mixed (at best) results",positive

"This book is a personal re-examination of food--what we eat, and why we eat it. In this book, Prentice examines food customs and traditions, searching for their physiological and environmental rationale.  Her primary observation about food traditions is that they are strictly tied to the seasons, and thus the continual year-round availability of our foodstuffs has resulted in loss of much traditional knowledge about what is good for us and what isn't.  In recognition of the essential seasonality of foods, Prentice organizes this book into the thirteen moons that make up the year, from the famine moon, to the sap moon, from the egg moon to the corn moon, from the blood moon to the wolf moon.

I have always been a fan of the STAR WARS saga but never really read any of the Novels. This was my first SW Novel. I must say i want to be a SITH. I just finished this novel last night and honestly want a 2nd coming. If u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth! the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the SW ripple effects. I however got more excited because i played KOTOR/EP3 The game/KOTOR 2 and Jedi Academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games.  I loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the Jedi in EP3.  It an amazing story and can't wait to a sequel if any. ,positive

"Reading late James - particularly ""The Golden Bowl"" - often strikes me as being similar to reading a novel in a foreign language whose vocabulary you have mastered but whose grammar remains partially a mystery. Anyone who has attempted this will recognise the sensation of understanding all the words, yet not understanding how they fit together. You read a sentence two, three or five times, and it is only then that you understand, if at all, the meaning of all the words combined. Sometimes the meaning never becomes clear.",positive

"I had a chance to read this book cover to cover. All I can say is &quot;absolutely outstanding&quot;, short of calling it a historical masterpiece in the field. Very rarely do I encounter an epidemiology or biostatistic textbook that reads so well. It is optimally reader friendly; the author appears to have such a talent in explaining some most sophisticated epidemiological and statistical concepts in such a simplified language. Yet he does not sacrifice the inclusion of some very advanced epidemiological and statistical concepts. New concepts such as causal graphs and instrumental variables are also included and explained beautifully. I strongly recommend this book to all early to intermediate graduate students majoring in Epidemiology. Established epidemiologists may wish to read this book to refresh and update their knowledge. I hope the author writes more textbooks with the same style",positive

"Though only a fraction of books have been written about the Great War when compared to WWII, there are some great ones to pick from. For instance, for a great narrative of the American involvement in World War I, try The Doughboys by Gary Mead. For a good look at the events of Gallipoli, just last year John Laffin wrote The Agony of Gallipoli, which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare. There is a great book which chronicles Verdun called The Price of Glory by Alistair Horne. The list goes on and on, whether it be Flanders, the Somme, Passchendaele, Africa, Jutland, whatever your area of interest might be. The point I'm making is, there are plenty of specialized accounts of World War I, and even several overviews of the war, but John Keegan's THE FIRST WORLD WAR, is a great source for an overall study of the war.

"If you want to read a book that's exciting, happy, and mind-blowing you should read Small Steps. From the author that brought you Holes, Louis Sachar, is at his best. This book is sort like a sequel to Holes. The main character, Armpit, is stuck in a situation which he can not handle. He is in the heat in Austin, Texas and I think it is making him do crazy illegal things. At first he did not know what he was doing was wrong, but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail. I think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above. Both boys and girls would enjoy this book. I think they should make a movie out of the book; it would get outstanding remarks. This is one out of few books that I could read over and over again.",positive

"Brooke Dojny's New England Cookbook: 350 Recipes from Town and Country, Land and Sea, Hearth and Home, is a stunning achievement, a magnum opus of a cookbook. Published by The Harvard Common Press, the book chronicles the cookery of New England from Maine to Connecticut, from the first Thanksgiving to the present. Dojny's approach to the region goes well beyond New England standbys like clam chowder (although she offers three tempting recipes)and spans practically all the food traditions of all the ethnic groups who ever called New England home. The eight baked bean recipes in the book include one for Cuban Black Beans and Yellow Rice and another for West Indian Peas 'n Rice. New England cookery has embraced food from all over the world -- besides Caribbean, you'll find culinary influences of Native American, English, Portuguese, Italian, Irish, German Scandinavian, Greek, French and Hungarian cooks  -- and all are represented in this book. Yet, for all its broadness of scope, this is a very personal book; Dojny's voice can be heard throughout, in the headnotes, sidebars and essays that describe the people and places associated with the recipes. The book is also a wealth of New England food history and lore, as well as tips on cooking techniques and ingredients. Bravo!

"Horror master Arthur Machen's crowning achievement, a still shocking compendium of interwoven short horror tales.   In late 19th century London, a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy.  In the course of their investigations, the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers.  The stories, which all deal with imposture of some kind, are only tangentially related to each other, yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand.  Machen builds suspense slowly and methodically, masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected, gruesome climax.  Comical, tragic, sophisticated, violent, horrific, and even downright disgusting, THE THREE IMPOSTORS is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit.    ",positive
"As someone who lived not far from Brownsville in the 1950s and early '60s, I can say this is an exceptionally accurate book.  It is well-written and is the best attempt I've seen yet at explaining the phenomenon of the changing urban neighborhood.  Not only does Pritchett provide many well-reserached, well-thought-out answers but, just as important, he raises insightful, penetrating questions.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in American urban history, particularly as it relates to New York City",positive
"As a boy, I was fascinated by looking at all of the drawings and descriptions in this diary.  It gave me a great appreciation for life in the US in the early 1800s, and the fortitude and ingenuity of our forefathers.

Written by native Americans it is a ""thanksgiving"" book from their point of view, why native americans have always celebrated thanksgiving.

"I wish I could give this book four and a half stars instead of four; I can't quite justify five stars in my mind.  Two of the stories were definitely good: the first, ""masked Riders"" by Parhelion, and the third, ""Ricochet"" by BA Tortuga.  I enjoyed both, but was not particularly snowed by the intensity of the conflict/plot line or the main characters and their relationships.  Not so the second story: ""Hung Up"" by Cat Kane was a powerful, intense and moving story about two delightful yet flawed characters who had secrets that tore their relationship up until they were able to work their ways (separately) around the issues.  That story deserved a five stars plus rating and I wish Kane would turn it into a full length novel and develop the characters and their backgrounds more.  This book is an excellent read both for the plot line and the erotic substance.  Enjoy",positive
"This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.",negative
"The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, ""[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man"". But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.",negative

Well, after 60 pages or so, I have got the feeling that the Staub is trying to wrap Jedi in Christian cloth and failing at that. The author speaks of the difficulty in leading a Christian life.

"Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get",negative
"Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America. He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing. His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved. His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States. He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy. He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history. His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the ""underdog,"" even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.",negative
"I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery. I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing. The characters were one-dimensional. After discovering who the ""bad guys"" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification. Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters. ""...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."" Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted. I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little",negative
"Heinlein loads this book up with hooks in the early pages to catch your attention. Unfortunately, these hooks turn out to be superfluous and lead nowhere. This shoddy technique is found in all four of Hienlein's final books. We are also treated to some of Heinlein's stock characters, dirty old men, horny female computers, naked adolescent girls, and dominant beauties who would be right at home in leather and whips. Without these archetype characters most Heinlein novels written after 1970 would have a sparse population indeed. As if this isn't enough, Heinlein drags in his usual cast of characters from his other novels as he is so prone to doing. In spite of all their cameo appearances, this group remains dull and one dimensional throughout. Heinlein's earlier novels written prior to 1960 are still fine fare for young people, especially boys. This novel, as well as most of Heinlein's later work will be enjoyed primarily by a group of die hard fans and is definitely not for general consumption",negative

"How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding",negative
"I agree with the reviewer who said this work is boring. It seems Roth is trying to glorify Philip Roth and not the characters.

Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!

This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant. In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of ""Glasnevin"" is misspelled ""Asnevin"". The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!

I don't agree with Bush's war and I didnt vote for him. But he's not a 'bad person'; he did not invade Iraq because he is 'evil' or 'stupid'. I can appreciate both sides of an argument; I can avoid generic categorizations. I would never watch any news, liberal or conservative, that had a clear political bias. Why can't Ann Coulter arrive at this same level of common sense? Well, she wouldnt sell as many books; she wouldnt be on TV. It has to be ""Liberals Hate America"" or ""The Conservative Nazi Agenda"".

It says you should plan on gaining a pound a week, and the more you gain the healthier your babies will be. Well the first 13 weeks I managed to gain NOTHING, and I felt horrible about it, but food made me so sick the last thing I could do was eat MORE food to try to gain weight. The book said that according to my starting weight I should try to gain 50 - 60 pounds during my pregnancy!

For example, Sloan describes a Sprint merger event in this way, ""If talk is getting cheaper, why did MCI WorldCom pay $115 billion to buy Sprint?

"Ethan Mordden's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book. This is the worst of his books on the various decades of the Broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs. His political ramblings (often just slightly right of Ann Coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down. The French people are slammed a number of times, along with the ACLU, Burt Lancaster (apparently, according to Ethan a good friend of Stalin) and the left in general, while the author defends Bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre). The author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man all over the page in search of a target, any target. It is often hard to stomach. The truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to look at the work again. An editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public. The author is capable of better work",negative

"This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody.

"The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse! Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references. Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it.",negative

"How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding",negative

"I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all.

I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish.

"I loved the earlier Nevada Barr mysteries, with their depiction of national parks and natural dangers. I wasn't as happy with some of her latest efforts, but still hadn't given up on her. Now I'm not so sure. This latest novel started off well enough although the idea of two severely traumatized girls should have been a clue as to what would follow. The idea that they were from a polygamous Mormon sect was a red herring. Perhaps it was Barr's attempt to show us how these girls were abused even before they met evil incarnate. The scenes where Anna realizes who the real villian is and her interaction with him and the poor tortured third traumatized girl went on for over 60 pages. Each scene was more disturbing the one before it. I found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends. But I have absolutely no desire to re-read the end of the book and find out. I wish I could say that I would read another Nevada Barr novel because I so thoroughly enjoyed the first ones. But after reading this disturbing, somewhat convoluted story, I would think twice. If I did pick up another Anna Pigeon novel, I'd make sure I had something else to read if the story took another dark turn. I would certainly not stick with it to the end.",negative
"Just wanted to quickly say I haven't finished it yet, I am only on page 20 but already this book seems very overrated. The author dives straight in talking about going beyond the five senses to achieve spiritual consciousness, but this is nothing new and we are not even given any background on how the author developed his views. Instead, he strides arrogantly forward as though he is the ultimate, conclusive authority on spirituality, and it's very aloof and, actually, not an enlightened approach at all! I've just started the chapter on Karma and it's really starting to smell like just another mish mash of other people's opinions clothed as quasi-originality. It looks like I'm going to continue reading with a very cautious, vetting attitude toward the text.

"Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy ""experts"" or ""scholars"" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture. If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming ""Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period"" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items)",negative

"""The number"" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. Eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. Eisenberg, a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.",negative

He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy.

"The author makes a couple of valuable points. First, any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent ""secular"" (i.e., indefinitely long) bear markets. Most leading investment advisors recommend a ""buy and hold"" strategy, but this only works during predominately bull market periods. Most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market, which is anomalous in historical terms. The author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that ""buy and hold"" doesn't always provide the best returns. Obviously, then, it's better to pull out during the bear markets, but that's easier said than done. The author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets, including P/E ratio, interest and inflation rates, and GDP. The problem is that those characteristics don't always correlate with market performance. For example, this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market. Well, if you heeded his advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005 and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. Even with high P/E ratios, a bull market can continue for several years: witness the late 90s. It's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. There is so much volatility on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched directions. By the time that it is apparent, it's too late to profit. Even in the midst of great bull markets, there might be week, month, or even year-long downturns. The author says nothing about individual stock picking, beyond a general value approach. The book is all about big picture, long term trends. Another problem is that the author's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. But the market (and economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. As they say, past performance does not predict future returns.",negative

However, I did a little research into just how violent place Los Angeles was in 1948, and the answer is not very. There may have been poverty, racism, alcholism, but L.A. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find, 1827! Mosley may have been more familiar with L.A. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way.

As for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke.

"A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.",negative

"The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel. Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.

Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.",negative
"Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because ""society"" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an ""A"" vs. students who earn an ""F"". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the ""wealthier"" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?",negative

"I started reading this immediately after the last REH compilation and there could not be a greater difference in story telling. While REH was first and foremost a story teller, Pressfield uses one of the absolute worst devices in his recount of a grandson of his grandfather's remembering his conversations with a client who knew the famous Alcibiades. This, as previous reviewers have mentioned, creates a large gap between reader and story. But why do this? Why use such a crappy method of story telling? I guess it pads the book with unnecessary dialogue. All in all, it's a slow, uninspired, day dream story.

"Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty",negative

You can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way. Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with it",negative
"Eugene O'Neill's play ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe ""Long Day's Journey Into Night"" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.",negative

That is so ridiculous. James Brown would NEVER say such a thing! Any student of funk knows that COLD SWEAT was the quintessentional funk piece and it is not even mentioned in the book!!! The style of Mr. Brown's sentences that are attributed to him sound NOTHING like him. I have no idea why this was put out.

I can say clearly that oneness does not play separation. Duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution. Saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion. Also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the ""mercy"" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic. Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.

It's f&#%ing comical. But guess what? The females' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males' are a lot of wishful thinking. Hmmm....aging, successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging, successful males are made for each other.

"This is a nearly verbatim rendition of the Grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why Zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children. Even harder to figure out is how the American Library Association could award its Caldecott Medal for distinguished American picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: The king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king, whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized ""servant girl"" to save the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. A weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with Renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad",negative

"I love Heinlein. I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction. I find that his plots and ideas are inventive. Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters. However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring. Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters. The &quot;main&quot; characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.

"I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over",negative
"I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing. I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru. They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories. The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines. I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing",negative

On to the review: I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.

"There are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is &quot;surprisingly suggestive&quot; of J M Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled &quot;The Employment Function&quot;.R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis",negative

"I'm not a cosmologist, but Stephen Hawking's Universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending. The language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper. Moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense Hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with Stephen Hawking. Sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a Hawking work. Naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading. I AM a chemist, and despite this, Filkin's descriptions of Chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).

"This collection of poems, tho representing a fine breadth of Dickenson's works, is in final assessment a crime against the poet's great talent. As is freely admitted in the introduction, the editor, Mr. Higginson, &quot;worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing the line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area.&quot; This is a free admission of the book's guilt, having adulterated Dickenson's original poems in both content and form. Gone are the nuances and passions that make Dickenson one of the best American writers. Gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems' meanings. And, worst of all, gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist. As Thomas H. Johnson says in the Introduction to &quot;The Complete Poems of Emily Dickenson,&quot; A representative mid-nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman . . . which he was not equipped to estimate.&quot; Do yourself a favor and avoid this text. Instead, find one that is true to the original poems, one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author, and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of Emily Dickenson",negative

"I picked up this volume because its title suggested that it would encourage hands-on science activities that are essential to good teaching and effective learning. Unfortunately, I discovered on reading it that the author combines a deep antagonism for the scientific &quot;establishment&quot; with credulity for numerous fringe ideas. The first experiment that he suggests tests the hypothesis that your pet uses psychic powers to tell when you'll be home for dinner! Sheldrake frequently presents anecdotes as &quot;evidence&quot;. The &quot;do it yourself&quot; promise of the title is broken for the reader who doesn't intend to begin raising homing pidgeons or doesn't happen to work in a laboratory capable of measuring the physical constants (such as the speed of light) to nine significant figures. Far too few cautions about the pitfalls of psychic research are given (in chapters about the feeling of being stared at, or &quot;feeling&quot; the touch of a severed limb). Despite the nearly fatal flaws of the book, I liked a part of its message, that important science can still be done by amateurs.

Every Breath You Take was such a disappointment. The plot, character development, and writing was not up to par.

This part will give you the chills ... nice touch. She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other. After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole. So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story. Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.

Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans).

"If you liked Whyte's previous sophomoric efforts, you'll love this. In addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler: in no real way does the story get advanced. Arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy. There are adventures, but nothing important happens. As usual, in Whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters. With all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, Merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in Camelot. Anyone who would read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship. So go for it. But please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good Arthurian efforts out there--Gillian Brandshaw, A.A.

For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept.

The book is also not organized well. In order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes. Points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book. Benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued. Throughout much of the book Benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of John Rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights. To be honest, I disagree with her views and admit that I might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if I agreed with her. Still, I do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically. Much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.",negative

In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, ""so and so was a devoted mother"" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading.",negative
The only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle. The rest is just quotations from other books. There is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half. The author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said.,negative

I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation. We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences. I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading. I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure",negative
"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic. and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy. yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring. every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending. not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, ""then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."" the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama. it would save more time just to watch a chick flick. so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!! if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.",negative

Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.

I wanted to know exactly what Braden claimed to have stumbled upon.",negative
"I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed. I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending.",negative
"IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted",negative
"I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between &quot;wicca&quot; and &quot;witchcraft&quot;. Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to &quot;chopping&quot; of source materials. This is a waste of money",negative
The writing was very disjointed in my opinion. I had to read and re-read many sentences to figure out what the author was trying to say. It was a struggle to read. No likeable characters.

"The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer. She's such a boring character. She's young, but not motivated to work. In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent. The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support. The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression",negative

Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture. I too found myself saying, ""Okay, we get it already..."" I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had. I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them. Oh please, no man on earth talks that way. Especially to other men. This book is completely aweful. The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention. I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst. I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better. I recommend ""The Alibi."" So far that has been my favorite by her. She has mystery, suspense, romance... Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels. To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book ""Toxic Bachelors."" I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author",negative
"I picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of Dr. King apart from the obligatory images we're force-fed each new year. Instead, I was disappointed to find that Eric Dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten. One such example includes Dyson conveying the idea that Dr. King may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right-hand man Ralph Abernathy. He then goes on to infer that there was talk of King and Abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other! The author had no commentary to either support or dispel this ""theory"" making Dyson's retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous. He just dropped the information, true or untrue, in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased. To that end, it is my opinion that Dyson's intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth-seeking, rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen. I'm reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me, ""an empty wagon makes the loudest noise."" Eric Dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance.

"I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind. I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character. Is there really such a thing as &quot;national character&quot;? People are just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? How well can you predict what people in your own country will do ? Would every Italian, if they could write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ? I seriously doubt it. So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians. After reading it, I felt even more strongly that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time. An informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ? Anthropologists have been concerned, for many years, in getting the &quot;inside view&quot;--the view of a culture as seen by the person within it. While Barzini is indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think. This is not a successful gambit. Cultures are based on many general factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family, etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific. Barzini covers many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by foreigners. But nothing really connects. There are only superficial, scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp. The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes. Barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history. These sections were well-written and interesting. But his portrayal of Italian &quot;character&quot; is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately, unconvincing. Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page. Myself, I got pretty tired of those lists. If you want to know something useful about Italy, read another book. If you just want entertainment, which might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could be for you",negative

"The literature of September 11 is never attacked. When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy. Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence. The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions. Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings. Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical ""trauma"" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation. Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are ""reading""---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216). Who has done the editing? Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar). If the term, ""reading"" even applies. Whenever a ""pregnant"" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image. When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well. Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough. (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.) Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages. Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance. Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence. Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well. Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal? As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases (""heavy boots,"" ""raison d'etre,"" etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: ""Sometimes one simply wants to disappear"" (184); ""There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself"" (184); ""Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers"" (245); ""How can you say I love you to someone you love?... It's always necessary"" (314). Whenever the author writes something that he finds ""beautiful"" and ""true"" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is ""beautiful"" and ""true."" The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity. We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, ""Emptiness"" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized. Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.",negative
"I was really looking forward to reading ""Ever After"" when I saw the favorable quote on the back cover by Larry Gelbart. But the book turned out to be a VERY cursory glance at the past 25 years of musical theater with remarkably little insight. Here are the three things I learned from this book: (1) Mega-musicals are almost always artistically corrupt; (2) Andrew Lloyd Webber is the anti-Christ; (3) The only innovative musicals to arrive in the past 25 years started Off-Broadway (mostly at Playwrights Horizons and Lincoln Center). Most of the hundreds of shows mentioned in this book get one paragraph each, with very few illuminating details. Here's what the author says about ""Carrie,"" perhaps the most famous recent Broadway musical flop: ""Carrie, of course, was an instant classic, a monument in the pantheon of failed Broadway musicals. Adapated by Michael Gore (music) and Don Pitchford (lyrics) from the notorious Stephen King novel (and even more notorious film), this $7 million musical celebration of prom vengeance and bad taste materialized at the Virginia Theater on the 12th of May, 1988 and was gone by the 15th, touching all who saw it with a timeless reverence for its indelible, monumental ineptitude."" Does that really tell us very much about this musical? Did Barry Singer even see the show? You sure wouldn't know it from this description. And just what, I wonder, makes King's novel ""notorious"" or the movie ""even more notorious""? Almost every show in this book rates that brief a mention, but somehow Singer finds time for an entire chapter of Lloyd Webber-bashing where Sir Andrew invites the author to a cocktail party to show off his newest female singing discovery. The chapter sticks out like a sore thumb, if only because it has nothing to do with the rest of the book, but also because it's one of the few times that Singer goes into any detail. Aside from a few interesting Sondheim quotes, this book is a waste of time.",negative

It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.

If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you. It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.

Like ""Striptease"", this book was full of typo's and appeared poorly organized and written. One would think that Ms. Shteir would have learned from her previous book--which also had similarly poor reviews. I wonder why Gypsy Rose Lee paired up with her.

I'm no prude but this was highly inappropriate and distracting people told me. On top of that, her article was chock full of misquotes, errors in fact, and adopted a perspective that nobody who attended the conference could relate to. Oh well, I can only hope that Ms. Shteir's next project will be more accurate and also that she will make clear her real interest in her subject matter.

"American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good. But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her",negative

"I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life. I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it. I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible. This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash. I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether.

"After anticipating the arrival of this book (that I ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), I was disappointed. Although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).

"How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding",negative

"The problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well. The author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation. Why could the equation not be solved? There is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book. Perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general. The reason is the subject of Galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one",negative
"I will not try to say that I asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no interest in doing so.

So as I said I have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower.",negative

"Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of ""evil"" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.",negative

Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos ""Carl"" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.",negative

"While it's certainly true that there will always be a gulf between reality and words, communication between reader and writer is nonetheless very real and potentially profound, thanks in no small part to empathy and the imagination. Deconstructionism, by denying presence and instead proposing unlimited differences between signs, dismisses any connection between readers and writers and turns language into a hermetic system separated from the outside world which is, of course, inhabited by people who read and people who write. This is exactly what makes deconstructionism so empty and hypocritical: It rejects traditional metaphysics while adopting a pseudo-mystical position which regards language as some unstable and solipsistic alien creature independent of everything and everyone",negative
"I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this one. It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. As I read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, I kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but I was left with despair. My major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. And bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. I will never touch this author's book again! A mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-Dan Brown",negative
"The author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about Superman and the writers to get the book to make sense.

"I am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by FAR the most one-sided book I've ever read. It wasn't about the crimes, it was about this author's personal feelings and dislike of Aileen Wuornos. He has a real problem with women, lesbians in particular. He made Ms. Wuornos out to be someone she wasn't. She had a hard life, yes and chose to committ crimes, but that wasn't what this book was about. Again, it wasn't worth the $.

"Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive. The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay. Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior. Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of ""My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."" I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population. I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!! I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.",negative
"Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average ""next person"" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) ""King Solomon's Mines"" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.",negative

People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it.",negative
"This is the worst novel that I have ever read by a major author. I have read a couple other Alex Cross novels and I did not find them to be awful at all. They weren't very good but they kept me turning the page. While I was reading this dreck I began to get a sense of Patterson's work ethic. He sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it. One maybe two chapters per day I suppose, and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result. Not a snowball's chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren't written by Patterson. I'm done. Don't waste your time. Really",negative

"I'm on page 110 of this book. The book has 220 pages. I'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person I am angry with. I bought this book because I have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. But, it is having the opposite affect. I feel I was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). Part 1 tells us what a ""grievance"" is. It tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. The thing is I ALREADY KNOW what a grievance is! I KNOW I'm angry at someone, and I know it's not healthy, I know to forgive would help me.... I didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. All that reading did was make me dwell and think MORE about the problem AND increased my anger because of the book itself. When I reached ""Part 2"", entitles ""Forgiveness"" I thought FINALLY.... but all Part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. There are some great reviews of this book here at Amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. But so far I can't agree with any of the positive comments. I have a great degree of respect for Stanford University, I went to high school across the street from Stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. Is it fair of me to write a review of a book I have not finished? No... but I'm afraid to continue reading it. I'm already angry and to buy a book that I thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, I don't feel is not all that fair either......",negative
"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""The Virgin's Lover"" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope",negative
"The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again. I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing. I mean Graceland for a first date? I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book. None of them can talk in complete sentences. And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years. There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer. And I'm a big fan of Roberts. I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work. But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be. I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.",negative

"The sub-title of this book is very misleading. It does not contain ""an action-oriented approach"" to raising your self-esteem - unless you count sitting down with pen and paper as an action. The book is centered on sentence completion exercises where you write the beginning of a sentence at the top of a page (""One of the things I dislike about myself is..."", ""One of my emotions I have trouble accepting is..."") and then complete the sentence with whatever comes to mind. For some unexplained reason each sentence requires its own sheet of paper; and there are a lot of them, so be prepared to go through a lot of paper.",negative
"I'd never read Berry before, but as far as I can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. However, it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. There are two related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of tone. The problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. So, while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of Berry's vision, there's no detail to back it all up. The problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. Of course, some of the pieces are lectures, but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. It comes out when Berry uses certain words such as the three As of ""appropriate"", ""authentic"" and ""adequate"". When these are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. The end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir.",negative
"I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago. I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work. Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was. The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself. It read like a poor book report: ""...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."" We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that. When the ""proof"" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable: Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character. Yeahsurerightwhatever. Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue. The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters. Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable. THIS is how men behave and relate to one another? I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.",negative
"Despite the description and synopsis on the books cover this is NOT a computer crime novel. In fact with the exception of about 20 pages total the novel quickly looses its snazzy cyber crime appeal. In the first few pages we're introduced to a dark haired female hacker but just as quickly she's gone and the book spirals into Japanese gangs, corrupt police, horribly bland and indistinguishable characters, and it just sucks from then on out. The story is good albeit incorrectly marketed. The characters however have no identity! They all sound the same, with the exception of the Japanese characters. Sadly the book lacks serious writing talent, very little character development, on what could've been a good story. One positive note perhaps is that the descriptions of Japanese culture, etc. are really good. Perhaps this is due to the authors departure many years before from England to Japan. My advice: spend some time abroad again",negative

"""Ha ha ha hah ha hah!"" That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank. Or at least I hope that's what he is doing. But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down. Quick! Stop me! I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron! The genre requires we make a leap of faith. And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly. But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this ""Tolkein as faith"" drivel. But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the ""thanks for the buck buddy"" and is himself laughing at us all.

"I forced myself to finish this book before I reviewed it, and being through with it now, I feel as though I've learned very little. I had so many problems with this book, or rather the way of writing, mostly stemming from the completely pompous arrogance of the author, that this was a difficult read. In his defense, he is, in MOST things, very thorough. My main and overwhelming problem with this book was that the author was arrogant enough to believe that he could relay what Leonardo was (or as he sometimes put it &quot;must have been&quot;) thinking or feeling. While I give Mr. Bramly credit as a man very much versed in his subject, in my opinion, that still gives him no right to use what I understood to be a faithful biography as a place to put forward his own views. Since he himself stresses that Leonardo's famous notebooks contain little to no personal thoughts or feelings, he has no basis for those statements and they are only his overconfident postulations. In the instances that there is a controversy over some area of Leonardo's life, the author is very good about stating that there is a dispute regarding the matter, but only puts forward his OWN opinion, and his reasons why he believes what he does, without explaining the opposite side of the matter. In this manner, he forces his thoughts on the reader without leaving them any choice in the matter. Sentences beginning with &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;In my view&quot; are not uncommon. He also makes certain assumptions about the reader, referring often to other artists' works with the assumption that the reader is as knowledgeable as he is about them. Also, he occasionally goes into great detail regarding a painting or drawing of Leonardo's, often drawing attention to coloring or texture, without ever showing it, though the book has many drawings and paintings throughout. The author is an undoubtedly intelligent, well-learned man, very erudite where Leonardo da Vinci is concerned, but entirely overbearing in his writing. Overall, unless you are well versed in the Renaissance artists and don't mind being pulled out of a book by the author's VIEWS, then I would HIGHLY suggest staying away from this one",negative

The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism",negative

I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it.

Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic",negative
"So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion",negative
"Mr. Shirley sneaks into Iran, hiding in the box of a truck, where he should have stayed. He spends 3 or 4 days in Iran, most of it trying not to be seen. He walks around for a few hours. He speaks to 3 or 4 truckdrivers, 2 or 3 shopkeepers, and a few assorted others, from which he assembles a complete picture and understanding of the Political and Social infrastructure of Iran. Along the way he explains, on just about every other page, how the CIA is a complete failure in every facet of it's existence, how all the career people in it's employ are arrogant idiots who are devoid of all compassion and intellect. He explains each of the Cia's mistakes, along with his explanation of what they ought to have done. He is, of course, ex CIA himself, having left it because no one there understood anything about anything",negative
"A favourite writer goes to prison, keeps a diary which proves to be an enjoyable read, then, upon his release, writes the worst book of his career.

The second half is about Magick, but it sounds more like High Magick to me. Where's the Dark Magick",negative

"Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some ""intellectuals"" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you).

They were not involved in the main events. She didn't even talk about what happened to them at the end. The judge is the only one that matters, and she didn't even write about him all that much.

"I recently decided to become vegetarian, so I got this book to read. I was very disapointed. I think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. This book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. This book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. I would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. This book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. I don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. However, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment",negative

"""Being a lover of freedom, when the [Nazi] revolution came, I looked to the universities to defend it, knowing that they had always boasted of their devotion to the cause of truth; but no, the universities were immediately silenced. Then I looked to the great editors of the newspapers, whose flaming editorials in days gone had proclaimed their love of freedom; but they, like the universities, were silenced in a few short weeks.... Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing the truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration for it because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual and moral freedom.

"""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and ""The Queen's Fool"" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. ""The Virgin's Lover"" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope",negative

"I was intrigued by his &quot;The End of History.&quot; I thought his &quot;Trust&quot; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. I only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books. In the end, &quot;The Great Disruption&quot; is a down right silly book. It has a lot of usefull data but Fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all. All his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion: that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good. Fukuyama proves that the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the earlier era has been wiped away. That crime has sky-rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. Then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital. He doesn't bother to deal with societies -- like Ethiopia -- that have never been able to build up enough social capital. He doesn't really look any further back in history past about 1950. His generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history. He thinks (based on his ideology of human goodness) that things just have to get better. If he had studied Pitirim Sorokin for a really big picture of history, he would know better. People can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does Fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long-term historical cycles. For that, I would recommend Robert W. Fogel's &quot;The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future of Egalitarianism.&quot; Fogel, a Nobel prize winner, has all the optimism of Fukuyama but with the history to back it up",negative

"Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series. However, I was very disappointed with this book. One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such). I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)! I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book. Also, I found the book to be too gritty. It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books. It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read. So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order. Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it. I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient. This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order",negative
"I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them. This one, however, is just awful. Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.

That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages. There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion. You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end. It's the Bataan Death March of novels.

Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit. Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid. Who on earth did kill Vance? And come to think of it, who gives a damn? I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt. Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero. Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic! The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ. I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth. Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought",negative
"Very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. Most of both Dem and Repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. Feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path",negative

"I have been slogging through this book for weeks now, it was a terrible shock to the system after John Julius Norwich's excellent book on Byzantium. The book lacks any narrative thrust, often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another. The one consistent thing throughout this book is the author's obvious agenda to ""set the record straight"" and prove that the Ottoman empire was far superior to its ""barbaric"" European contemporaries",negative
"Cruel, horrible story with a typical Barr convoluted plot. The abuse of children, evil ranger poising as a dead ranger, freaky religious sect, dead animals on the bed, and lost children were all too disturbing and disgusting to me.

Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs.

The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. &quot;Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!&quot; Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him.

There's very little political analysis, almost no attempt to portray what diffiulties Wilson needed to overcome, and no passion at all in the writing. Actually this book feels a lot like a high school term paper that someone knew they had to write and just wanted to turn in for a passing grade. Auchincloss talks a bit about the two Wilsons (one good one bad) and hints at Wilson's dependance on women, but neither of these positions is fleshed out or used consistently.

"This book has major shortcomings; Stein's obsession with character over plot, for one (Martin Amis said, ""I used to sneer at plot until I wrote a novel that had one, titled NIGHT TRAIN. It was HARD and I used stay awake at night hoping I wasn't leaving any holes.""), another being his obsession with ""show don't tell"" (Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and it's almost entirely ""tell"" and very little ""show."") And the passages Stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (A taxi ""disengorging"" its passengers is categorically bad writing.) And Stein admits he rejected Frederick Forythe's THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. I wouldn't read a book by Dick Rowe about how to make it in the music business (Rowe famously rejected the Beatles from Decca Records). Stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline, but then Rowe was going by just a demo tape. Better writing books are out there",negative

"It's always easy to criticize somebody's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars, but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable ACTRESSES and not STARS of the studio era. So it comes pretty natural to ask : Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook Margaret Sullavan? Was Grace Kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to stunning results?

"This book was recommended by someone a lot more financially successful than I am. But while I was reading, I kept asking myself, ""When's he going to get to the point?"" The first part of the book is all about why it's good to be rich--something I thought was unnecessary. The bulk of the book is filled with anecdotes that try to illustrate the different mindset of rich people as compared to middle-class and poor. Finally, in the last part of the book, he gives some practical examples of what he considers to be good investment strategy. This was the only part of the book I was interested in. To me, it was like his publicist told him that no one is going to buy a 30-page book on investing and so Kiyosaki wrote what he knew about making money and filled the rest with ""fluff"". However, even his advice is considered questionable by many experts. I would say that the main idea I got from this book was to try to look at investing from different angles and not to just follow the crowd. I just wish I hadn't invested so much time in a book that could have been a lot more concise",negative

I know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.",negative

"There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's ""The Journey"" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as ""lugubrious."") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed ""it."" But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's ""Louis and Antoinette."" As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English",negative
"You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of ""moist"" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one.",negative
"I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie. I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good. Not so with Howard's End. The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige. You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable. None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world. I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance. The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later. Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry. There definately is an audience for this book. I'm just not a part of it",negative

In short, it was a competent work of fiction.",negative

"I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental.

The cast is made up of &quot;distinguished actors,&quot; the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school. Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line. The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!

My English teachers will cringe when I say it, but this book, well, sucks. It may well be great literature, but the characters are not engaging, and if it was Woolf's motive to out-do James Joyce in chronicling a day-in-the-life and in writing a stream of conscious narrative, she doesn't pull it off. Again, the characters and the internal mental life simply don't have the power that ""Ulysses"" has. Reading Woolf is necessary for a good eduction.

Misfit insecure Caucasian male falls for Asian stripper/prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets. I thought possibly this story reveals a lot about Olen Butler. He wrote about this relationship with such relish, he sounds to me like a P.C. Caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the ""otherness"" of Asian people and doesn't see them for what they are, just wants them to appreciate big strong white man. I thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother. So she was not honest with him. But Olen Butler wrote about her as if this stripper/pros. was wonderful, the kind of wife any man would want. I shook my head and thought, ""You have issues.""

"I am Vietnamese and I grew up in New Orleans during the 80's and 90's when the first waves were settling down there. I hate to tell this to everyone on this site but this book is the worst piece of fiction ever written. Like many books written by someone who does not belong to the culture that he writes about, the book takes great liberties with the imagination and presents the stories from the viewpoint of the writer and not the actual people. The Vietnamese characters in the book are portrayed as backwards, uneducated, and simple. Further, the stories are depressing and very few of the characters seem to have any success. If you actually grew up in New Orleans during the time that the Vietnamese Americans were setting root during the 80's and 90's, you would know that by and large, the community pulled itself from nothing to become quite successful. No real Vietnamese American thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book. I repeat - no Vietnamese American thinks or acts like the characters portrayed in this book. The book repeats many of the fallacies that I have noticed in other books written by predominantly caucasian male authors about East Asian Culture. There always seems to be 1) an asian prostitute 2) caucasian guy with asian bride 3) asian male in an emasculated role 4) asian people as backwards and simple. Quite sad. This book reminds me quite a bit of Memoirs of a Geisha, though that portrayed Japanese culture in a better light.

And another thing, there are a lot of positions that are not even posible, and some only with a giant swing, or how about a horizantal or verticle pole...yeah many people have those in their houses.

It seems she should have spent more time with Turabian's Manual for Writers, than surfing the web or watching Sienfeld",negative
"This is one of those books where you actually feel embarrassment for the author. The book is poorly researched, poorly written and, well, words just fail me. While I am not a great Herriot fan, I do have to give him his due - the man could write well and could tell a good story (isn't that what authors are suppose to do?) but this guy Graham Lord, I suspect, has problems feeding paper into his typewriter! The intire book is such an obvious ploy to make some money on the shirttail of a &quot;dead&quot; and popular author, it is rather nauseating. Shame on the publisher for accepting such shoddy work! I did finish the book though (thank God I did not purchase the thing) because each page became worse and worse and I could not stop, thinking with each turn of the page &quot;well it just cannot be any worse than that last page/chapter.&quot; How wrong I was! If you must read the thing, borrow it or check it out of a library. I would hate to see a person waste their money, and I certainly would not want the author and his publisher to be rewarded for a work such as this. Herriot's life, warts and all, could be such a fastinating subject. I do hope someone will turn out a good study of him eventually. We certainly did not get it here",negative

I doubt that most people considering a book titled ""Whole Grain Breads..."" are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients. With that being said I thought the book had some good recipes and was well written. Therefore, I am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none.",negative

"While this book is a good reminder to high school students and their parents of the kinds of illiberal attitudes extant on many college campuses, I cannot recommend it to other readers. The author unfortunately perpetuates the right-wing-Republican-only stereotype believed by many outside evangelical Christianity. She battles as much for her political leanings away from gun control and in favor of all Bush administration policies as she does for the truth claims of the gospel. Indeed, in reading some of the chapters, it is difficult to see that she has any concept of a Christian worldview that might veer in any part from Republican platform positions. This is really too bad, because she makes many good points and appears to be courageous in her positions. I would not have begrudged her political point of view at all, had she made a clearer distinction between that and her theological position",negative

I have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with Carl Rogers, and William Coulson as instructors. Any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job Ms Milton did presenting them. She should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book. Her bias is extreme and obvious. So consider this when reading the book. No doubt Ms Milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs. I am sure Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology",negative

Te book just goes to many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to originally acomplish. Furthermore, I find it quite unusal that the author chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . Is this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.As a college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support from his argument. All in all, quite disapointing as I found it at my local bookstore and the cover looked interesting.

OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a ""happy"" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually ""triumphed"" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a ""happy"" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.",negative

"A subject of eternal fascination especially for basketball &quot;nuts&quot; who grew up in New York. We idolized the terribly tarnished CCNY &quot;Wonder Five&quot; who set an unbreakable record by winning both the NIT and NCAA titles in 1950 (it can never be repeated because of the way the tournaments are now scheduled). This book is a fictional addendum to Rosen's non-fiction treatment of the original basketball &quot;scandals&quot;, as he outlines in his NPR interview. Unfortunately there are glaring albeit minor errors -- Broadway and 43rd Street cannot be on the east side of Manhattan; Madison Square Garden has been on 23rd Street, and is now above Penn Station; in between it occupied the block bounded by 49th and 50th Streets and Eighth and Ninth Avenues. These errors are particularly galling in a book by a New Yorker who played at Hunter College, and they undermine the author's credibility and care in writing. Since this is a fictionalized account of a real occurrence, the game of who is this really is inescapable. Hence it is most unfortunate that Rosen in his interview avers that some players who were not prosecuted went on to pro careers, and &quot;a couple are in the Hall of Fame.&quot; This tarnishes by inclusiveness such stalwarts as Bob Cousy (Holy Cross, '49), Dick McGuire (St. Johns, '48), Bobby Wanzer (Seton Hall, '46), and Frank McGuire, the legendary coach at St. John's, North Carolina and South Carolina",negative

Before starting the reading of this book, I was in the agreeable mood with the author's that machines can never be human, and that AI will retain (if not forever) for a very long time its name - unreal. But, now, I am dismayed. The author unsuccessfully used 450 pages full of topics in mathematics and physics to support his point of view, making simple topics sound difficult, and making diffcult ones look impossibble. The inclusion of his strange tilings is strange. All in all, the book does not make sense. Moreover, his 'Note to the reader' (which is patronizing, arrogant and deceiving), and his Prologue and Epilogue (which are at best cynical) should have warned me not to venture any further. I cannot help feeling sorry for myself and for several other readers; and most of all, if this is the author's usual way of communicating his ideas, for his students. Luckily, I did not buy this book; for one person, who could not stand reading through it, dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor",negative

"Well, the fact that I'm writing a review about this book, while it's sitting open on my desk next to my computer, open and not being read, might be some evidence of how I'm enjoying this book. This book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so difficult. This book is not clear or easy to understand at all. Every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote, and the masses of footnotes together take up half of EACH page (!), making this work look like a research project for a PhD publication. I have the casebook in this series, and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. And it turns to be true! This book might be good if you're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail, or as an advanced reference later on, to look something up like in an encyclopedia. Some concepts, which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book. It's too complex for a first-year student. Sometimes it starts describing the different views out there, and then there's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is.

Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania. Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history. I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.

"Firstly, let me say the research Nicholas Lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature. His data sources are vast and highly informative. The major limitation of this publication is that the central argument is biased. Lardy selects those data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view. As a result, major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over. Lardy's view is the typical Western, dare I say &quot;American&quot; argument. Primarily he uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of China's state banks. This methodoloy is extremely poor - particularly in the context of China's trannsitional economy. Financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency. If anyone would like elaboration on this point feel free to email me. In summary, Lardy's book is informative and makes for interesting reading. However as a piece of economic analysis, its usefulness is limited. The major reason for this is a total lack of economic theory(as indicated by the previous reviewer) which has resulted in a poor methodology",negative

"Written in cartoon format, I thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of scientists. However, it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids. The cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible. Further, some content is offensive. On the second page of cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying, ""No woman is worth committing suicide over."" The pictures show a scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is now picturing in his mind. Irrelevant and inappropriate! Plus, I didn't have to go far to find swear words in the captions. Yikes! My kids will never see this book! It is not even appropriate for high-school age kids.

"Phil Jackson groupie and sometime ESPN.com writer Charley Rosen turns in a fun, but sometimes off-putting fictionalized account of minor league basketball life. He develops the characters well and puts forth a decent plot. However, Rosen's personal oddities drag the book down.

My roommates and I all read it and the general consensus was that the book was enjoyable, but Charley Rosen is a really weird guy",negative

"I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing. What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy. This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga. Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent. In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell. Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter",negative

"I read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before I read ""Reviving Ophelia"", because she wanted to see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided. All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. Some girls it may ""make feel less alone"", but for me it only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the library before you buy it",negative
"If you like unimaginative phony crap you'll love this book. The proposed animals within this book are utterly stupid and improbable. An antelope that feels through the snow with its incredibly dumb looking antlers? A DIURNAL and TERRESTRIAL mammal that for some God-forsaken reason lacks eyes of any kind? Primates that don't evolve to fit man's niche, but instead take on the roles of otters and flying squirrels? The thing has got nonsense written all over it. The ""future animals"" proposed for this book were not well thought out and somebody, please find Mr. Dixon a liguist, and FAST! Some of the names he gives these future animals are so stupidly childish that they actually detract from a creature's plausibility. A vortex? A posset? What jerk scientist of the future is naming these things? Can he please be institutionalized? I admit the pictures were well done and pre-teen children would probably enjoy this immensely. I know I would've when I was 10 or 11, and there's nothing wrong with that, it's just that Dougal Dixon begins the book in a very advanced scientific way discussing food pryramids, chains of evolution, and ecological niches, but then converts to unscientific baloney around page 30. All in all, I just don't think it's cut out for people over the age of 12 or so, unless you are just looking for fun and imaginative creatures. But in that case, why restrict your mind with the laws of evolution? Why not pick up a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Monster Manual or something like that with lots of mythological and imaginary creatures? I find that books intended to showcase the fantastic, do much better outside the realm of (somewhat-boring) science",negative
"Typical Feinstein (""A Season on the Brink"" excepted). Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc. This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island. The subtitle, ""Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black,"" is used here as a figure of speech, meaning ""behind the scenes."" (""Inside the ropes"" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.) Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion. We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course. Yet the book does not fulfill its promise. My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for",negative

"As I sat here writting this review my rating dropped from a three star rating to a two star rating, and I now realize that all of my malice and discontent could have easily been diverted if the book were titled ""Drawing People: A Technical Guide for Beginners"" and mentioned nary a word about the clothed figure. Then if I had of stumbled upon this book it would have been an added bonus that the author took the time to outline some basics on clothing and drappery, instead of a full out disappointment. Not that I blame the author solely, most of the blame lies at my door. I was so overjoyed in finding a book that proclaimed it was specifically about drawing the clothed figure, Brune Hogath's book aside (another devastating disappointment), and that it was written by a professor from the Academy of Art, a school that I am still deciding on attending, that instead of going my normal route (ordering the book through the store, checking it out in person, and then ordering it online so I could get a fatty discount) I impulsively bought the book, only reading the book synopsis and barely glancing over the customer reviews (which all looked favorable).

Yet the author ambles from here to there in a disjointed narrative with interesting nuggets but little insight. Where's the big picture?

It is filled with mediocre 'funny' patters that the readers are encouraged to use, but the quality of the actual magic effects demonstrated is poor.

Ms Wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of Literary Criticism or a biography. The book suffers from too much critical analysis of Sassoon's poetry and not enough about his life.

"I love mysteries set in WW II and like old time radio so I couldn't wait to begin this one. The ""hero"" is a junior varsity Tom Joad but,OK, I was game. The cast of characters that seemed to number in the low 80s and be interchangable ""baddies"" and ""goodies"". They were hard to keep track of without a scorecard but there is no quit in this reader and I pushed on. Then when we got to the Jersey shore, I found out that in 1942 with America fighting for it's life against fascism, and losing, our hero knew why. All the servicemen were bullies (A drafted station employee) or morons (the Coast Guard beach patrol). The 4F ""hero"" was the real McCoy however. Although not actually mentioned I bet he wished that dratted ear injury hadn't kept him from joining the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. He was moderate enought to think Marxism had some problems; the murder of 10s of millions of Ukrainians and the Nazi-USSR Pact probably and I say probably, didn't elude our observant literary genius. He was also a 1975 era feminist; all those plucky WW II women throwing off the handcuffs chaining them naked to the kitchen sink had his unhesitating support. Most big businessmen, probably wearing spats and silk high hats, were the bad guys needless to say. I wondered how someone could write such a truly awful book. I couldn't finish it and it's a point of honor for me to finish all books. Then in the bio it all became clear. The author was a flack for former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder of Colorado.

There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind. The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session. No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.

"After reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that Nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged. McGinnis boasts of Nixon and his PR teams ability to hide the &quot;true&quot; Nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image. He proclaims that the real Nixon was the one that the country saw debating Kennedy on TV in 1960. Nothing could be further from the truth. First off, Nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation. All historians admit that JFK had help from Daily in Illinois and LBJ in Texas. Furthermore, in the 1960 debates, Nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and JFK's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! If anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was JFK using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and JFK the family man and the idealist. JFK exploited the Missile Gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated Ngo Dihn Diem, wire tapped Martin Luther King, screwed up the Bay of Pigs, and had ties to the Mafia! Now, I could be wrong, but JFK's campaign sounds like a true selling of the President. 'Selling of the President' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays Left Wing propaganda of the 1960s",negative
"If you like physics, this is just an interesting book. It mostly discusses, at length, two ideas: emergence and reductionism. Doesn't sound like much, and it isn't, but at least it gives you a different point of view on the world. Unfortunately, from this point of view to the horizon is not that far. Mr. McLaughlin almost calls the present theories (like string theory) science fiction, easy on science (because of the scales and energies involved, he seems to think they are not provable; I don't have the knowledge to discuss if he is right or not), but he doesn't offer much of an alternative.

"Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology. However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement. There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests. This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques. The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid. The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.",negative
"My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of ""The Prince of Tides."" Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature. Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf. What a joke! Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real. She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions. One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story. I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths. In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book. They do not speak in reams of figurative language. I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children. Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them. (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.) It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.

The information on Weezer is great, but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band and gives too much information on things that even the most obsessed fan won't care about. Unfortunately, this appears to be the only book on Weezer out right now, so if you want to learn more about the band in book form this is all you've got. I suggest just browsing around their official website, because it's obvious that's where the author got quite a bit of his information. Don't waste your money",negative

"Was given this book as a freebie--someone must be buying up copies. For an Austinite, this adoring account of the life of a hasbeen fifth-string techno-celebrity is a little embarrassing in its breathlessness--kind of reminds one of the courtiers who saluted when Louis the XIV's chamber pot was carried by, except this isn't the Sun King, guys.

"I am ashamed to say I read this entire book. I kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. It is filled with typos and poor organization of thoughts and topics. Clarkson actually spells Mel Gibson's name wrong several times throughout the book, and refers to Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner as ""Dormer"" for several pages! He jumps back and forth from one movie production to another making it difficult to follow. Lastly, he relies on the accounts of people who had met Mel Gibson at one time but who had either a personal or professional conflict with him. In the retelling of these conflicts and what went down, we hear one point of view only - and generally that is the view of someone who is harboring bitterness and resentment towards Gibson, so their accounts are slanted and untrustworthy. The best part of the book is the end for two reasons: Clarkson finally gets to Gibson's most recent project, The Passion of the Christ. The subtitle and the picture on the back of the book gives the impression this project will be a major focus of the book, but after 300 pages of reading, I was still waiting for the subject to come up. I have to say I felt that this was the only well written part of the whole book - thoughtful and interesting. The second reason the end is the best part of the book is that it was finally over. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I can't help it. I highly recommend reading the book about the making of the Passion of the Christ - you can learn a lot about Gibson there - but I cannot recommend this biography",negative

"I am sorry to say that I thoroughly disliked ""Of Human Bondage."" I know it is on every must read list for fiction (which is why I decided to read it) however, I just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature? Not only did I find it dull but I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character's perception of women! I'm not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways. ""Yellow teethed"" ""Sallow skin"" ""Dirty Hands"" ""Tear stained over powdered face"", it goes on and on. I wondered if the author was uncomfortable women? I looked online for some information about Maugham. To my surprise I found out that Maugham was bisexual. He did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men. In no way can I say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book -- but in some way it answered my question or concern.",negative
"One at the front: The really own words of the master are excellent. One must make sure that only 43 sides of the only 7 x 5 inch small book are interviews with Bruce Lee.

But the words of the master are absolutely worth-while, as already mentioned at the beginning",negative
"This book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses. I practically wore mine out over a year-long course, and came to know it intimately. Dummit and Foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples. Of course, examples are very important. However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products). They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor. Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them. Also, the bindings on this book frequently fail. My book fell apart very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem. I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit and Foote.",negative
"For the most part, the author seems to have pretty good information for the time of the book's printing, but for anyone who wants to read this book on purely scientific terms, be warned; there are several places where the book goes awry, for example: the author states that tracks of tyrranosaurus indicate that it was a solitary animal, occasionally hunting in pairs. Problem: no tracks of a t. rex have been discovered to date, a decade and a half after the writing. Aside from that and a few other points, though, the book is good reading",negative
"This is the worst book of Shakespeare criticism I have ever read. Bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next. It reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend. He contradicts himself several times. I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier. To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts HIMself. He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30. Apparently the point is that if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom. Bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker. He has not grown up yet. That is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom. Some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes. Interespersed between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived. Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying",negative
"This book is a disappointment. It provides little insight into the life or personality of Robert Redford, the actor or the person. The book is basically a chronicle of the movies RR has directed or in which he has appeared as an actor. But even as a filmography the book fails. The reader learns little about the creation of each movie or the relationships among the actors beyond the anecdotes that have been repeated numerous times on TV or in the press. In addition, the authors have the annoying habit of consistently putting down Robert Redford with snide remarks. There must have been something about the actor other than his white teeth and good looks that made him an international superstar. For sure, it must be difficult to write a biography of such a private person as Robert Redford. However, it is the responsibility of biographers to gather information and gain an understanding of their subject, and if they can't do so, then there is no book",negative
"This dictionary is just another long-winded, pretentious, unreadable, high-brow attempt to legitimize anthropology.

It is a poor &quot;guidebook&quot; and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue. The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres. The only upside is that it is short. Yuck, what a waste of time. My advice is: get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book. At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails. Actually, in terms of a travelogue, &quot;Vendela in Venice&quot; far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.

"I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of &quot;the problem&quot;. Nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload! Even after wading through the numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his conclusions and would caution readers to do further research. Certainly the Baby Boomers are an aging bulge in the population of the US and will create some challenges. However, the author fails to mention the &quot;echo boom&quot; (baby boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every year. Both of these facts will &quot;soften&quot; the impact of the &quot;Gray Doom&quot; that Mr. Peterson tries to create. I just don't anticipate the tremendous problem of which he tries to make us aware. But I did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth control will have on our future. Another disappointment was very little discussion of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and the impact of aging populations",negative
I was really looking forward to reading this book since I am both a brain researcher and a professional musician. First it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework. Much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted. Even this was sparse at best. He attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it. However it became too watered down and even lost me. Lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments. Pushing the envelope of science should be award enough. For these reasons I can not recommend this book,negative

I mean look at some of them they are so cheesy one of them actually refers to the author as Mr. Miller who is he brown nosing for sounds like a greeting card they are so ""textbooky"" and insincere. The book itself is almost entirely filler on how to read music (which half the music books in Borders are or they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless, which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short) up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory. Book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics, never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when I asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along.

"This is a decent book on photographing artwork -- but not the the most comprehensive. The strengths of this book are that Mr. Saddington (1) discusses the use digital media, and (2) makes the process of photographing artwork very user-friendly by providing great visual references throughout. The user-friendly aspect is the book's strongest selling point, especially for artists who are new or novices at photography, or visually oriented (i.e., no patience for reading instructions that come with few or no pictures). Mr. Saddington's book provides pictures of what makes a bad negative exposure/photograph, and provides a concise explanation for these results, and does the same for an example of a good negative exposure/photograph. He also provides illustrations of setting up equipment and artwork for photographing. The weakness of this book lies in the general details provided ... unfortunately, Mr. Saddington provides a limited amount of helpful hints and leaves out specific details for for problem shooting ... I base this opinion on my comparison of this book with a book called &quot;Photographing Your Artwork&quot; by Russell Hart. If you buy Mr. Saddington's book, I'd recommend supplementing it with the purchase of Mr. Hart's book. The two books complement each other. Where Mr. Saddington's book lacks in details, Mr. Hart's book fills in the information gaps. On the other hand, Mr. Hart's book is very text heavy and has very few illustrations ... so if you're a visually-oriented person, Mr. Saddington's book would easily compensate in the area of illustrating this very important process. Again, Mr. Saddington's book is decent, but it should be used as a supplemental reference, especially for the visually-oriented person",negative

"I didn't have especailly high hopes for this book. I think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of HH books over the years, and this one brings it to a new low. Basically, it's waaaaaay too long. At 850 pages, it's a monster read, and a slow one. That's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page. But not here. Why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language? For several paragraphs? More than once? Why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services? I think I'd be in a very small minority when I confess that I quite like the 1662 Prayer Book, though I can't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for decades! Maybe it was easy to cut and paste, and got the word count up.",negative

"I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee. The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.

If you need good, suspenseful stories, try Lois Duncan or Caroline B. Cooney! One great, outstanding, wonderful book: Swimmer-Graham Masterton",negative
"This book was so simplistic. I was quite disappointed. You get the impression his main goal was simply to reassure people that they are normal after all. A worthy goal, but when discussing something as complex as sexual fantasies I really think one should try to pursue things to their limit. He really held back from delving into any dark territory. His explanations for why someone enjoys certain things left out quite a bit. He always managed to put a happy, positive spin on everything, which is nice, but life isn't that simple",negative

"If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student",negative

"I too read the TA for Tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago. She loved it a lot so I've been looking for it again, this time for my grand-daughter. Even though the title is different from the original one I knew, I purchased it and read it as soon as I received it. Bottomline: this story is _not_ the original one and I don't like it at all. Other than showing stereotypical Happy Prince and Princess fairy tale characters (which I can live with up to a point), I saw bunches of red flags when I got to the evil witch, drawn with a full-blown ugly face ""who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan"". Unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies. Without enough warm fuzzies (we read earlier) it puts people ""in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die"". Ouch. So instead of embracing the wisdom of old women, here we have another story that villifies them (OK, I'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all). No, it's not funny, and there is no way I would introduce this book to any child. The book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are, as the original book did. Too bad, for using images of ""warm fuzzies"" and ""cold pricklies"" is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children. I am returning the book.",negative
"Overall, I found this book disappointing. In its defense, its basic thesis of the movement of Jewish American Orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely religious) is interesting, and I am sure accurate, and Heilman's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched. However, I was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray Hareidi society through the prism of its own value system, or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all. Heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader, and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations. Examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture. Hareidi society has its own worldview which, although too complex to elaborate on here, has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values, reasons which Heilman completely disparages or ignores. (For an example of a book that is not written by a religious author, yet is able to appreciate Hareidim from their own perspective try ""Real Jews"" by Noah Efron). In general, I found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the Holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the Hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition.",negative
I have to admit the title and discription of this book was very alluring but it was merely a mask. I have had the book for two months and just cannot seem to get though it. Although the first few pages were very catching with the author immediately opening with a murder scene that is discribed with enormous detail; it just doesn't click for me. I f ind it very hard to read more than a paragraph at a time and the story seems to jump around everywhere causing confusion of both characters and storyline. Surely if you can get through the first few chapters it may become interesting but I just cannot do it my self,negative

"When I discovered the existence of this novel, I was enthusiastic and intrigued. Unfortunately, my hopes were more or less dashed as I trundled my way through the 382 pages. KLEOPATRA focuses on the famous queen's early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family (something she may have compensated for in adulthood). What I liked: 1). The spelling of Kleopatra/ Cleopatra with a ""K""- it really does emphasize that Hellenistic connection; 2) Kleopatra's strength of character- Essex's general characterization is appropriate and it's easy to see what Kleopatra will become.",negative
"Other reviewers have taken pains to outline the ""plot"" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. Suffice it to say author Kathryn Harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that ""more is better"" , offers estrangement between identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion, mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused New York shrink. This reader was aching for the hero, Will, to book himself onto Jerry Springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from Ms Harrison like ""It's just...it's...What is it? Will doesn't have a word for what he feels."" (Perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author, however, should not. In any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences among so many examples.)",negative
"This ""book"" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to ""One-up"" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.",negative
"Herf applies a very simplistic test to determine the Nazification of both Germanies: did they side with Israel in the Middle East version of the Cold War or did they not? The trial against Paul Merker in the East, which had as its background East Germany's reluctance to pay reparations to expropriated Jews, serves as his prime evidence for the continuation of things Nazi in the GDR. But both of these arguments completely ignore the Marxist ideology underlieing the rationale of the East German leadership and bypass more complicated issues of political allegiance. Moreover, they totally eclipse the East German cultural discourse on the Holocaust, a discourse that was decades ahead of discussions in the West and still proves to be more sophisticated than most that is being written in Western academia.",negative
Eliot Cohen has an impressive background in policy work (OSD) and academia (Naval War College and Harvard). I had high hopes for this book because I thought his experience with the military combined with his academic work would produce a focused and well-grounded work. I was disappointed. I never really bought his argument that political leaders can lead war better than generals. He seemed to cherry pick leaders than fit his mold. I could not believe that someone who works so closely with the military would generalize military leadership in such a stereotypical way.,negative

It is entertaining, the style works, etc. On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it. My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book.",negative
"It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying. The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about. The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it. Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets. Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS. The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.",negative

Lance Armstrong is good at chronicling his many bicycling events and achievements in this book, but what is notably missing from this text is the experience of a genuine champion. Lance Armstrong would sell his own grandmother's last pair of socks in order to succeed -- leaving his family behind in order to pursue his one-dimensional goal of winning the Tour de France. He sold his wife and three helpless kids for bicycling success and he degrades the sport and his wonderful family by publicly flaunting his association with a pathetic and desperate rock singer ... yawn.

"I will not lash out against anyone, and I will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious, ostentatious egotism. That said, let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes Jesus of Nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to accept. First off, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of Jesus's morals in general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must provide a trenchant analysis of Jesus's codices. The key point here is that Jesus's older analects were deluded enough. His latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale. Jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in number. I indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet I keep reminding myself that Jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. His desire to control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind is the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff.

"I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book ""The Sigma Protocol"". It says ""In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy."" Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter ""ordinary man"" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this.

After we spoke, I sent her my newly purchased copy and she called me back to agree that it was the single most destructive thing she had ever seen in her fifty-plus years.""

It is just that, an example, not a training. So, there is one 14 note ""lesson"" on intervals and from this you are supposed to magically learn how to identify all the major intervals. I don't think so. However, if you were an instructor then you could use that example as a starting point to develop your own lessons and work with students in recognizing intervals.

"Need I say more than the above title suggests? Okay, so the upside of this book is that it has important life lessons and epiphanies from the voice of experience. There are some touching moments in this book, but even then there is still something the author is lacking. I saw the movie when it was in theatres and I have just finished reading the book. I liked the movie soooooooooo much better than the book. The movie was funny, entertaining, touching, personal, and sad at times. The book did not captivate me at all. I had trouble staying focused. Considering Beverly Donofrio's credentials--a bachelor's degree in English from Wesleyan University and a master of fine arts in creative writing--her quality of writing is very poor. Her quality of writing is more like someone who has only a highschool education, if even that. And not to go off topic, but since Donofrio has a master of fine arts in creative writing from a top notch school like Columbia U, then why doesn't she write about something else besides her getting pregnant in highschool and how that has changed her life? I mean, after all, the MFA is in creative writing, meaning she should be more creative rather than just write autobiographies all the time. She has only wrote 2 books--Riding in Cars With Boys, and Looking For Mary, both about her getting pregnant at a young age. If you liked the movie, just leave it at that. Don't bother reading the book unless you enjoy getting disappointed. And if you're interested in a novel or autobiography about teen pregnancy, then go to the local library. Don't get this one. There's other novels covering the same subject that are far superior to this one.",negative

"The Venona Secrets is a deceptive book. It tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of Soviet spying in the US, but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing ""Liberals"" than in painting a true portrait of their subject. Although the information the authors provide is interesting, the biased and heavy-handed way it's presented negates whatever scientific value it might have. For example, the authors insist that J. Robert Oppenheimer was working for the Soviets (they call this a ""fact"") yet they present absolutely no proof that Oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic, naive man who couldn't keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of Communism in America was money to the CPUSA. The book is full of these so-called ""facts"" with little to nothing to back them up. The authors praise Joe McCarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti-Communist hysteria of the 1940's and 1950's, ignoring the fact that MCCarthy capitalized on fears of Communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal. McCarthy's methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by Stalin are completely overlooked, as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign. The authors also praise Senator Henry Jackson as some sort of all-American crusader against Communism, not even mentioning that all of Jackson's anti-Communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti-Semistism and hatred of blacks. Overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of Liberal ideology -- one can simply hear the disdain for Liberals dripping from the authors' prose -- and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right-wing propaganda who want an objective account of Venona. The authors have sacrificed their credibility for their Conservative agenda; they deserve not to be taken seriously",negative

I'm certainly not a member of the aforementioned ""Scientific School of Audio System Performance Analysis"", the only instruments that can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side of your head. I listen to what my ears tell me sounds good, and generally, tubes sound good. Which is why this book is sort of a disappointment, you'd think that out of 80 projects there'd be at least one tube phono preamp, but unfortunately there are no tube amps, just a few rants about how tubes don't produce enough power. Who uses more than a watt anyway? Even the transistor amps presented aren't much better than what you could get from Rex or Circuit City, similar schematics could probably be found on the internet for free. Go ahead and buy it if that's the sort of thing you're into, but if its tubes you want, try Morgan Jones' ""Building Valve Amplifiers"", it doesn't have many schematics but it covers in great detail the layout and contruction of tube amps. Good schematics can be found on the intarnub",negative

I'm not saying Bush would have won if Walsh hadn't indicted Caspar Weinberger on the Friday before the election, but Walsh made a next-to-impossible task unattainable for Bush.

"I grew up reading Harold Evan's Sunday Times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could. I particularly remember comprehensive coverage of Egyptian President Sadats historic visit to Jerusalem; ongoing coverage of Soviet dissidents and a very welcome (I'm Irish) editorial urging Britain to consider withdrawal from Northern Ireland. However, from today's perspective, the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the world do without Henry Kissinger?' [Indeed this has always seemed to be Mr. Kissinger's view also]; and that Soviet unreasonableness was a product of American hawkish unreasonableness and that balance, compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation. My memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in California and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of Governor Reagan. A major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of Soviet missiles (SS-20s?) being deployed in Russian forests. I was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern Sunday Times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of Saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist.",negative

"This book was required reading for a class on children's literature. So, naturally, I was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there. The beginning was quite exceptional. I even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening. We were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts. Due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature. We set the book down and did not finish it. If you are looking for good children's literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.

"I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times? Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot;, and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior. The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the &quot;Rock n Roll Circus&quot;. A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong. As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read",negative

It's hard to imagine this book being of much value even for a true and complete novice to prospecting.

I wanted to like this book because it is a Christian novel with a good purpose. Ninety percent of the books I've read have been secular but I'm starting to read more Christian novels. But to me, this book fails for three reasons: the marriage conflict between Mark and Allie isn't believable, the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight, and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing.",negative

So it just makes no sense to act as if it's usually the parent's fault - why alienate and beat up your target audience????

"If we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the Prague Spring and street protests in the U.S., as Kurlansky attempts in this book, the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year. The reader is owed specifics, yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes. Prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent, but prohibited it. Chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government, however flawed, resulting from open debate. A bigger difference could hardly be imagined. But Kurlansky does see striking differences, albeit only in the post-1968 world. The Soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion, while the capitalist West avoided the same. His disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean, though what manner of ""revolution"" he envisions is never rendered to specifics, likely for good reason. But who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do",negative

"I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women. Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule. The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.

As the plots became being built upon the same structure, the suprise is getting less and less after each book.

It's very much: the southern Jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. He does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'Yankee Jews', like the instances when a few (Yankee)Rabbis in the South fought for civil rights.",negative
"What this is: an epic adventure. It would be imappropriate to review the WOT series when speaking of the Prophesies of the Dragon book; it's also not really a supplement akin to, say, The Monster Manual for D&D--the only extra skills, feats, backgrounds, etc are those directly related to NPCs in the campaign. What Prophecies is designed to do is take a party of characters through their first six levels of adventuring, which correspond roughly to the first six books of the series of novels. The players are allowed to play a key behind the scenes role in the story of the novels and cameos have been scripted for many of the book's key characters. It's a really ambitious undertaking; players have to be given a compelling storyline, feel like they're making a difference in a campaign that covers over a year of game time, without letting them change what happens in the novels.",negative
"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Neal Stephenson's books. The historical content he winds into his plots is engaging. However, I have been working with the micro computer since before the command line. Neal, you have the title wrong. In the beginning was the Monitor. No doubts in my mind. My right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed! The Command line came much later, more like the coalescence of matter in the Universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity. The Monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches, address load and register load momentary switches. The Monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all. So, 2 stars because the title is just wrong",negative

There are just so many things wrong with this book that even the grating ""famous names"" don't really stand out for me. Let's see, where to begin: the naive political ranting, the unspeakable dialogue, the corny love interest, the wholly implausible technology, the absurd coincidences, the distractingly disjointed structure, the proliferation of minor characters, the talky explanations of the detective's thought processes, the total incompetence and corruption of the police - I can't go on; it's hackneyed and poorly written, and that's all there is to it.",negative

I thoroughly enjoyed her first novel, Pink Slip, however, this one seemed depressing. The two main characters appeared to have no respect or show any outward love toward each other until the very end of the story.

The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real. Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf",negative
This book is for the diehard Dave Navarro fans only. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative.

Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--""Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?"", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.",negative

As the Iberian peninsula physically separates from Europe, several unengaging and underdeveloped characters (the most interesting of which was a dog) wander from one destination to another with meager purposes, certainly none I cared about.

"'Introducing Postmodernism' is a good source to gather names of philosophers, architects, artists, anthropologists, linguists, and everyone in between that have been somehow connected to PM. The problem, and it is a big one, is that this style of tour de force writing does little to contextualize all these diverse disciplines. Sure, if you only have half an hour to read up on PM, you can whip through this book and go on with your life. But if you're wanting to really absorb the phenomenon, and perhaps go on to read more, this book is NOT the place to start. Check out David Harvey's 'Condition of Postmodernism.' This will rip the top of your head clean off! It's much more weighty (in every sense of the word), but your understanding of PM will vastly improve, and will better prepare you to go on to other important writers of the 'genre'",negative

Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared. The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared. The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films. Throughout the book the author treats these two as the &quot;Coke and Pepsi&quot; of infrared films.

The author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing. Unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not. The character of Robert E. Lee in the book is just too, too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts.

Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking???

One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war.

The book had the feel of so many pages of anti-Disney propaganda, and the repetitiveness of a bad serial. The authors of Celebration U.S.A. clearly made up their minds about Celebration long before signing off on a mortgage. Lacking in the detail needed to illustrate Celebration's experiment with the tenets of neotraditional style, the book offered splashes of cliched generalities such as ""a return to the past"" and ""recapturing tradition."" It soon became some sort of mantra exhorting Disney's ownership of the town, the rules imposed on property improvements and maintenance, and, interestingly, the attention the town received. Most tactless of all was the shadow of mockery cast on every description of residents, conversation with neighbors, and interaction with people doing what the authors SHOULD have been doing: giving the town a chance",negative

"Susanna Rowson's &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor, pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin. Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings. &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now &quot;Charlotte Temple&quot; has been rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition. Was this reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above list of rediscoveries. Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's &quot;Evelina&quot; or &quot;Camilla,&quot; Rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity. Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates. In many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed. Rowson does not criticize men within the novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him. He aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting &quot;dishonorable&quot; against her. Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility for his role in Charlotte's downfall. Rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with Montraville but she fails to take it. Instead, Rowson places the blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men. Madame Du Pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the Montraville/Charlotte &quot;elopement.&quot; Miss La Rue, the woman who pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women. Why would modern readers want to read this? I do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep our interest. Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading",negative
"I read this book for a book report, and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it.

"I have several dummies books, from how to build a PC to CCNA. I had to read this rediculous book when I worked for a very well known DSL provider on the East Coast. This book was trivial, assumes that you are completely mindless and plugs certain products and services shamelessly. Yes, I agree, Hot Bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only one out there. This book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement. Easily the worst dummies book in print, and Im not being a jerk, I love dummies books, Ron Gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap. You can honestly get more informed with a magazine",negative
"Although a majority of readers obviously loves this book, I have to say that it really seemed like a waste of money to me. Our only daughter left for college this year, but fortunately I have trained her in time to be independent. If your kid doesn't have a clue how to live in the real world and if if you're still willing to do everything for them and not have them take responsibilities for their own lives, this book is right for you. Not in my dreams would I have made lists for her what to take because she can well do this herself! I do miss her and she misses us but that does not mean clinging dependency! I expected different things from this book, on a deeper psychological level",negative

"I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market. Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one. The spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements. In several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread ""may or may not"" mean some karmic element at play. The whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define. Therefore, when a card ""may or may not"" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you ""may or may not"" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning. Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity It is difficult to have it both ways and I found working with these spreads difficult. Imagine doing a Celtic Cross reading and the first position ""may or may not"" be the root of the issue. These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader. I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous.",negative
"Blind Items has the same writing style as at least one of Rettenmund's other books (Boy Culture). He goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs. Kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the Sunday magazine section of your newspaper. If you like this writing style, Rettenmund's books may be for you. Personally it drove me crazy and I set the book down after the first few chapters",negative

"Normally I like the entire ""female power"" thing but frankly the ""this is wrong"" or ""evil"" part of that storyline is really old. In an era where girls do try out for and get placed on ""boys"" teams, these issues seem outdated. Likewise rules were recently changed in Indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender. I know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening. Overall I felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different. Even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her ""magic"" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking. How much more gender role enforcement can we have? Really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a Buffy universe story do better than this? In general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding",negative
"While I think the basics of the book are good, I don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option. I did much better on the South Beach Diet, where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods. Fat is what makes us feel satisfied. After years of trying to diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me I could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived. An omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary. Secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat. I just noticed this week that Cool Whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients. This can't be better for you than actual cream. I also prefer the book ""French Woman Don't Get Fat"", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good, natural food when it's in season. The pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle. I feel that the G.I Diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before. I think this book is about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated. It certainly can help get people on the right track, but I think there are better books available.",negative
"I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, ""For Better or Worse"", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again.

"I purchased this book several months ago. During that time I've tried several of the recipes - the French Lentil soup is very good. The chili and corn biscuit casserole was unappetizing. The chili was so-so and the corn biscuits were too heavy to my taste. The recipe for Mushroom, French Lentil and Chestnut Ragu says to ""see Glossary"" for the chestnuts but there's nothing in the glossary regarding chestnuts. It wasn't until I read another recipe (Smoky Chestnut and Sweet Potato soup) that chestnuts were discussed. The Mediterranean Salad sounds good on paper but was lackluster. Far too much red onion (which my guests mostly picked out). Although a number of the recipes are relatively simple there are several with very long lists of ingredients that take too much time and too many utensils to prepare. As someone who works full time, a 20-ingredient recipe holds very little allure, no matter how good it sounds. I had trouble finding some of the ingredients. For example, the author specifies several different types of squash which I haven't been able to locate at any of my local grocery stores or farmer's markets. The book is organized in menus which are not listed in the table of contents. If you're looking for a specific recipe you'll have to spend some time with the index trying to locate it which is not convenient. The author definitely has some good ideas but this book probably will sit on my bookshelf more than on my countertop",negative
"Some of the stuff in here was really screwy. It's not a handbook to the &quot;Food and Mood&quot; book by Elizabeth Somer, which is what I thought it was when I bought it.

The activities that are suggested are a little simplistic. For example, &quot;laying sticks apart from one another and pretending it's a river, and then have the kids jump over it and playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls.&quot; I was hoping for more endepth activities. If it's your first time camping this books okay, but if you've camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the book falls short so look for something else",negative

He just tells you that you need to tie them together. What if you don't have a shoelace to use? What other alternates are there?

None of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book. Darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent. True, parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have. But I'm just thankful Amazon has a customer-friendly return policy",negative

"&quot;Our attention is the most precious resource we have,&quot; says Shenk. Well...I'm not sure everyone would agree. But this is the way he would like to slice the whole matter of information technology, the media, etc., etc., and that's fine. Shenk's standpoint is amazingly isolated and will make sense only to an elite ensconced in the same high fallutin' mix of punditry/technology/leisure time he is. Information overload, or &quot;data smog&quot; as the author terms it, is certainly a relevant and important area to explore, but Shenk, in is privileged world, really can't nail down what might be so detrimental about it. His examples illustrate just how removed his is from the vast majority of American society: minute-by-minute news reports diluting the quality of info and the ability to sort it, not feeling so apt to respond to your friends' email because you get too much, the end of patience? As he represents it in &quot;the end of patience,&quot; data smog really ain't no big woop--it's just some tacks on the erogomic seats of a pampered minority into which Shenk seems to fit. Where's the politics, I wonder? How does this trivia fit into the lives of Middle Americans or working people? To the point, Shenk might benefit from a step or two away from his computer. Rubbing shoulders with the common folk might hip him to serious problems like acne or Monday Night Football",negative

"Some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. Two Thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. Think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or Vogue or Madamoselle magazine today. Many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic. One in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. Don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. Instead get ""Shaven Angels"", ""Natural Beauties"", ""100 Naked Girls"", or ""Crazy,Sexy Girls"".",negative
"I was extremely disappointed with ""After Midnight"". The author, his widow, has written the book from her own life's perspective, and there is sadly little about the true Brad Davis. His homosexuality, or perhaps bisexuality, is mentioned only in passing, and anyone in New York or Hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life. I guess a book written by his wife can't be expected to delve too deeply into this area, but even other interesting details - his drug addiction, his acting technique, etc. are only minimally suggested here. I wanted to put the book down after two chapters, but kept waiting for it to get interesting. I suggest the publishers retitle the book ""My Life with Brad Davis - The Saga Of A Wife Kept In The Dark"", or something similar, to indicate to readers that this book is about Susan Bluestein, and tells very little about Brad",negative

I got really sick hearing about Tess's cute freckles and Jimmy's movie star looks/sex drive. The majority of the story line between Tess and Jimmy has them arguing over a one night stand.

The central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters.

This genre is rapidly sinking into self-referentialism, and Armstrong is the worst culprit. In Industrial Magic, she ruins what could have been a perfectly good story with these unfunny namechecks and rebuttals to writers who are actually better than she is. On top of that, the viewpoint character, Paige, is unfortunately named: she's as flat and boring as the pages she's written on. Her central relationship is with her boyfriend, Lucas, but their coupleship seems to revolve around the trading of sexual favors. Are we supposed to think this is cute and funny?",negative
"""The Burning"" was a big letdown after reading Bentley Little's masterful book, ""Dispatch"". I seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while Bentley was ill and couldn't write. Who knows. I love this guy and can't tell you how disappointed I was. While one of the top 5 horror writers working today, Bentley Little seems to be hit or miss with his stories. I simply just did not enjoy reading this new release. It seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick. And, with everything he was trying to do, none of it - not one moment - was scary! Shadow creatures performing random oral sex, creeping fungus, talking voices in the microwave, deformed goblins peering in windows, skeletons climbing out of mud pits, tunnels filled with moving corpses, and a runaway ghost train crashing into the White House was just too silly. It reminded me of his previous work, ""The Return"", another disappointment containing silly, bizarre, and unrealistic situations.",negative
